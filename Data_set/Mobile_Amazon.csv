B0117H62QK,4,"Price - 9/10 ( 12,999)Build Quality - 9/10Specifications - 8/10**NOTE TO BUYER** - If you need more than 16 GB, Xiaomi has launched a 32 GB Mi 4i. If you need a good cover, you can consider the Heartly Armour Case.- BREAKDOWN -Display - 9/10Camera - 9/10 back and 8/10 frontSpeaker - 7/10Battery - 8/10CPU - 9/10GPU - 8/10 PROS:- Premium feel, light as a feather- Superb form factor, comfortable to hold and operate- Clear screen, slim bezels, sunlight display really works- No heating issues with latest update and 2nd Gen Snapdragon processor- Sharp back camera, sufficient front camera- Dual flash for different light conditions- Decent battery, lasts one full day- Dual 4G sim- Smooth but limited MIUI 6, could be better- Great for gaming- Supports HEVC/H.265 videos natively, so great for movies and videos- Free Screenguard from Xiaomi if you register your mi 4i on their website CONS:- No Micro SD slot (This can be a dealbreaker)- Speaker could be louder- Phone is slippery despite matte finish, definitely requires a cover for grip- Not a big upgrade from Mi 3, apart from the processor- MIUI is not the best OS, I think vanilla Android is better- No point in 4G capability since only a few cities have 4G network IN THE BOX:- 5"" Mi 4i- Rapid Charger and USB cable- Instruction manuals- Pin to open the sim card slotSorry for the long review below, but I didn't want to miss anything :(- PHOTOS -I have attached some photos to this review, which I clicked with the Mi 4i. All the filters are in the MIUI camera app. I hope they can give you an idea of how good the quality is. I have also included the Xiaomi Mi Pad next to the Mi 4i to give you an idea of the size. They look like brothers.- FULL REVIEW -I owned a 1st Generation Moto G before I bought this, and I was not sure about the Mi 4i. The Moto G has no expandable memory, so I am stuck with 16 GB. I have always required more space because I like to carry a lot of music with me. But I ordered the Mi 4i despite this shortcoming, because apart from the memory issue it has great specifications.The packaging of Xiaomi products is very classy. It comes in a plain cardboard box with simplistic designing, and all the necessary accessories are included inside. Makes for a great gift. No headphones are included with the Mi 4i. You can check out an awesome pair of Xiaomi Mi Piston 2 headphones by clicking on the link.- PROCESSOR & UI -The Snapdragon 615 processor, 2GB RAM and MIUI 6 (User Interface) work together to deliver a nearly flawless experience. You can see that MIUI is heavily influenced by Apple iOS, while maintaining the open-source attitude of Android. Unlike the Xiaomi tablet, this Operating System works well on phone. The OS is updated regularly, and this version is based on Android Lollipop out of the box.The Snapdragon processor and native video player support the latest video format x265. This format fits full HD movies in half the space. This means 1080p movie in ~1GB!Gaming is smooth, Asphalt 8 and FIFA 15 run for hours without any lag whatsoever. I never experienced an overheating issue, but some users were reporting heating for intense 3D games and benchmarking apps. The issue should be resolved with this updated Snapdragon. All functions such as wifi and bluetooth work perfectly, and it does well under heavy multi-tasking. I find that the MIUI launcher has limited customisation. The best way to solve this is to install Nova Launcher. The premium features of this app are incredibly powerful and pirated APKs are available online. If you like the application, I urge you to buy it through the Play Store and support the developer, it only costs 200.- DISPLAY -The screen is vivid and does a great job with colours. Picture and video quality is outstanding, and colours are warm. I feel the Moto G has a brighter screen, but the Mi 4i has warmer colours. It is responsive and no touch-lag was noticeable. I personally don't like big devices, so I think the 5"" screen is the right size for portability and usability.- CAMERA & AUDIO -The 13 MP main camera is well tuned and takes excellent pictures and videos. The front camera (for video chat) is also a decent 5MP and does good quality video recording. The dual flash is a great feature when you require lighting of a warmer kind.The mono speaker on the back is clear but could have been louder. The inbuilt DIRAC sound card has been specially designed to work with Xiaomi headphones. I have a pair of Mi Piston 2 headphones, and when you change the audio settings to match the headphones, it makes the bass thump and gives the sound a studio feel. The improvement is tremendous.- BATTERY -The battery lasts one full day, and charges to 40% at hyper speed if you use the included charger and cable. But for the size (3120 mAh) and big.LITTLE technology of the Snapdragon 615, I feel it should last longer. Unlike the Mi Pad, the Mi 4i phone does not have ""performance"" and ""balanced"" modes.- ISSUES -The biggest problem I have with the phone is that memory cannot be expanded. I carry a lot of data and like to use my phone as a portable storage device, but this is not possible with the Mi 4i. It only gives 12.77 GB to the user, which is even less than the 12.92 GB offered by my Moto G. Vice President of Xiaomi Hugo Barra explained that ""microSD cards are vulnerable to failure and in most cases malfunction in various conditions"". Although he is right, I think this is a compromise we must make to enjoy the benefits of more memory. If the memory cannot be expanded, then the phone must be available in 32/64 GB models.Google and Apple have also given up on expandable memory, because they want users to move to cloud storage. However, this is only feasible in western countries where wifi is almost everywhere. In India, access to the internet is not always available, which is why most people like to store their data on their device. Using the cloud to store data also creates more security risks, and I can't shake the paranoia of China trying to steal my information.Apart from this, the phone is very slippery despite the matte finish. I have already dropped it twice from about 3 feet height, but it has survived both times without scratches. You will definitely need to buy a cover for the phone. The grey colour is also more attractive than the white because it blends well with the screen and bezels.Lastly, MIUI is good for first-time smartphone users and dummies, but too limited for advanced users. Original Android would have been best, but no AOSP ROM is in sight. I feel these are important issues, which is why I reduced one star in the rating.-- VERDICT --The Mi 4i has all the ingredients of a flagship and is outstanding value for money. But 13 GB of space and no expandable memory is stupid. Maybe the more expensive 32 GB version is a better choice.- THANKS! -Thank you for reading this far!

B0117H62QK,4,"I have used almost every device Mi has released yet and i was really satisfied by them.That's why i decided to buy the 32GB version of Mi 4i.If you were following my reviews,i have already reviewed the Mi4 here http://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R239TK6Z0HPV9T/Xiaomi says that the Mi 4i was designed to be a flagship phone for the 'emerging markets'. The entire package is good enough for most people looking for a powerful mid-range phone.Apart from the storage capacity, the Mi 4i 32GB specs are the same. To recap, the Xiaomi Mi 4i features a 5-inch full HD (19201080 pixels) IPS OGS display. Under the hood is a second-generation 1.7GHz Snapdragon 615 octa-core (1.1GHz quad-core + 1.7GHz quad-core) 64-bit processor paired with 2GB of RAM.The smartphone also features a 13-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel selfie camera, and a 3,120mAh battery with quick charge support. Connectivity options include dual-SIM card slots with both supporting LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS, and on the software front it runs on Android Lollipop-based MIUI 6.------------------------------------Lets start with the review-----------------------------------#DESIGN--------------Xiaomi decided to go with a simplistic design with the Mi 4i in sharp contrast with their previous releases, the Mi Note (and the Note Pro). The Mi 4i uses a very simple rectangle design that utilizes a polycarbonate battery cover that is non-removable. Its soft touch matte design feels very smooth and luxurious for a phone at its price range. Xiaomi says that the rear of the Mi 4i has an anti-grease coating that won't stain even if you mark it with a permanent pen, though I never tested that out.DISPLAY--------------The Xiaomi Mi 4i features a 5-inch, full HD IPS display with 441ppi (pixels per inch).Its got a great screen which is far superior in sunlight readability or outdoors than the competition . I compared the Mi 4i's display with the Mi 4 and saw that its older sibling displays more vibrant colors and overall better color definition. But it doesn't make mi4i inferior ,in real life scenarios probably you cant see the difference unless you really i need to.PERFORMANCE-------------------------Xiaomi uses the Snapdragon 615 processor, which the company says was especially tweaked by Qualcomm for the Mi 4i. The second generation version of the 615 uses a slightly faster main cores (four cores running at 1.7GHz) and four 1.1GHz lower energy consumption cores for mundane tasks. Paired with the 615 processor is 2GB of RAM plus the 32GB of non-expandable storage.The Mi 4i got a score of 42418 via Antutu, which is a pretty decent score for a phone at its price range.Heating-------------As its snapdragon 615 the heating issue is kind of a normal.But still xiomi did there best in tweaking it for mi4i and helped reduce the heating to some extent.The Mi 4i is no exception ' under full throttle, the phone registered a very hot 44.5 degree Celsius. But it wasn't uncomfortably hot to hold, rather like the Mi Note Pro. With normal browsing, the phone reaches up to 36 degrees Celsius, dropping to 33 in standby Mode..Will update the review after upgrading to MIUI 7.CAMERA---------------Xiaomi Mi 4i is equipped with a 13-megapixel rear camera with dual-tone LED flash, along with a f/1.8 aperture for extraordinary low light performance.Even though there is no optical image stabilization the pictures came out really sharp.The color reproduction is fairly on the higher side and you surely can't get something better at this price.Talking about the selfie,The wide angle lens again wins over most of the selfie crazy phones at this budget.Which again is a plus point.In terms of overall video recording the quality is really good and the noise cancelling microphones does a great job.Battery--------------Good battery lifeXiaomi has equipped the Mi 4i with a 3k+mAh battery. This allows the phone to go around full day of normal use with browsing, calling and watching videos in Facebook. and much more.The battery gets recharged pretty quickly considering the capacity. Didn't notice any quick draining as of yet.Conclusion----------------Its really worth investing over the MI4i 16GB.I would surely recommend the 32GB version if you don't wanna carry OTG pen drives everywhere you go.Have a nice day...",631,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Hello Amazon Team,I really dont feel like rating a single star to this mobile. I purchased the mobile on Oct 15, 2015. Its been just been 4.5 Months and its stopped working & having restart problem. 'Its getting restart after 5 Mins and sometimes i can't switched on'. I have faced this problme during March month. In April month, I went to Xiaomi service center. The service centre did the SW reload and after that problem was not solved. Again after one week i visited Xiaomi service center said, MotherBoard has to be replaced and  it would take 10-15 days for parts to come and you need to wait till then. then it took 2 months for the part to come after my several visits to Service centre. After they relaced it, the very next day i was facing similar problem and then i visited service centre again the very next day and they again did some SW upgrade.But again the same day i was facing all earlier issues and again visisted Xiaomi Service centre on 2nd June, after lot of arguments they again replaced  'motherboard'. But story not ends up here, same day in evening i had same problems (Auto/On/Off ). Visisted Service centr again, asked for replacement, but they told no such policy they have. they can just repair multiple times despite they can't identify what is real issue. Neither they are providing me 'DOA' or any other certificate.For no fault from my end, I'm facing a loss. Financial loss, yes, but more than it, its the emotional loss for the brand name & trust. This incident has made a great impact on my feedback on Brand 'Xiaomi'. As individuals, we give away let go money many times in our day-to-day activities/transactions/purchases if the product is good/ trust worthy brand.I don't know for some reason, I don't feel like my money Rs.10000/- let go. Neither I wish to spend a single rupee on this Mobile repair/replacement.I am very much harassed. Now, I know Amazon is a big Brand and can help me in replacing my mobile.Kindly, provide me a replacement for this.Regards,Amit Singla",109,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Would recommend not to opt for any Mi products infact will go a step ahead and state that i was skeptical about purchasing electronic goods on line and with this deal my worst fear came true.In the month of june 16 i booked a Mi 4i cell phone and it was delivered within a week(invoice no:KA-BLR5-141777691-1149043) as my sim card had not arrived i started using cell phone from 17th june 16 it worked fine till 30th june 16 then all of a sudden found that the battery was not getting charged.my first thought was that there might be some issue with the charger(adaptor) but it was fine and then i took the cell phone to Mi service centre located at theen haath naka,thane on 4th july16 where i was informed that the mother board has conked off and will take 2 weeks to get repaired(WXIN1607040003669),till date there is no sign of my cell phone and the repairing work is still in progress.i would suggest AMAZON to take some corrective measures or stop promoting Mi product else i would be forced to believe that AMAZON has a share in this conning business.regards Amith pillai",5,1
B0117H62QK,2,"The Xiaomi Mi4i has a great features but all those features are useless for me..Cons:1. Less Vibration2. Contact list does not allow to see the profile pic.3.

B0117H62QK,1,"Hi guys,After using this phone 8 months it stopped working suddenly and its been more than a month and I have submitted it to one of their highly rated service center in daryaganj in delhi. But its been more than a month I didn't get any response from them and and when I tried to call them they don't even receive phone calls Then when I personally went there to ask update around three weeks ago they told be that they don't have parts and again after one month they are giving me same reason that they don't have parts moreover the main person of the service center was also abusing Mi service .I am Sharing my worst experience as same was happened with my brother also.I am keep writing mails to ""service.in@xiaomi.com"" and ""xiaomi_service@mailsy.custhelp.com"" but always receive auto generated mail from them.I am sharing all the mails in attachments please take a look.",4,1
B0117H62QK,1,Worst phone ...

So please please.. don't buy this phone...,13,1
B0117H62QK,4,"This mobile deserves appreciation. Want to know why, lets find out.I used this phone for 2 months thanks to my ex-office they gave me this as my daily driver. It is one of the best in it's price segment.1. Good display - Thanks to its 1080p IPS panel the display is very crisp with good contrast ratio and brightness level. The sunlight readability is also pretty good.2. Fast charging - The phone fully charges its 3120mAh battery in around 2.5 hours which is quick. If the phone didn't have this technology it would take it to charge in 4 to 5 hours.3. Good camera - If you take lot of photographs in the day light then this is the best camera you are going to get in this price range. But in low lights the camera suffers as the images tend to be grainy. Though the HDR mode does help a little bit in improving the quality. But in comparison to other phones in this price segment the low light image is decent than other phones. Take a look at the photos samples.4. Software - The operating system is pretty smooth as well and very user friendly. The company has also rolled out the update which makes it even better.5. Performance - Thanks to it's 2 gb of ram multitasking is a breeze in this handset. But the phone lags sometimes because of the mid level processor, but it is fairly smooth if you don't throw a lot of graphics intensive games at it and keep the settings at medium level during game plays. Normal day to day operations is very smooth and fluid.The phone slows down a bit when minimizing some apps. This is not very frequent but 1 out of 10 times it slows down and a message displays ""Just a sec..."". Find the screen shot of the same attached.I recommend to buy this phone if you want a decent camera (photo samples attached), with quick charging battery and good display at this price segment.If you found this review please hit the like button it would not take more than a second of your precious time. Thanks.",73,1
B0117H62QK,1,My Mi4i stopped working and service center said they will not be able to repair the same.It's was still under warranty and they do not have any parts.They also do not know when the parts would be available.They have my phone from over a month now.Very poor Mi service.Avoid Mi phone due to poor service and unavailability of parts,4,1
B0117H62QK,1,This phone is such a waste. The screen is of very poor quality and cracked on it's own without any physical impact. The customer support is worthless. They simply won't reply to your mails.,26,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Hi,  The package delivered too late.  the first installment charged even before the package delivered.  the Camera does not work !  Bless my stupidity for buying this product.",5,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Fourth grade customer service, bunch of jokers, truly a Chinese phone nobody willing to help.  My phone had some issues with Mic, I gave it at Mi Service centre 4 weeks back but have not got my device back.  Still the service centre is saying they willl take a weeks time to get the part.  They have been saying this for a while.  Nobody responds on email, twitter. Call centre is clue less.  You may buy a cheap phone with good features but god forbids if anything goes bad in your phone you will be helpless.  And looking at the long queues in their service centre I am sure they manufacture substandard phone.  I am far more disgusted than I may sound in this review.Avoid it!!!!!!!! Shame Xiaomi you are truly third class.... Fyi,, I bought 2 more Mi phones before this happened :(((  Dont Buy Mi....",74,1
B0117H62QK,1,I recieved a faulty piece from amazon.in tried with service center and all but was not able to get it corrected.my phone was just 10 days old when i found it was defective.it has beed a month nowBut the amazon customer care seems to be liable.thry said thry would grant me a full refund.so need to waitAnd about phone despite being a defective piece.It has got some of the greatest specs simple looksOverall a good bet,3,1
B0117H62QK,1,very very disappointed...only 12 hours and phone got hanged....and finally it tot bursted in my bed...........cheap cheap cheap. This is not about the money itself what about the life which is on stake if you came across this kind of products! My hand is get injured and luckily this phone is not get busted while talking to some one otherwise I would have not able to write this review even#######!!,3,1
B0117H62QK,5,"Worth every penny you pay for.Been using this mobile for 6 months and it is definitely worth every buck you pay for.It does not have any serious heating issue as many claim. Maybe it is because of the continuous upgrades. It was delivered very quickly by seller.The quality of the pictures are very good for a 13mp snapper and the 5mp selfie camera also does a wonderful job with many enhancement options.The Slow motion mode of the video camera has only one format and resolution which was indeed a let down. However, it did come great.The major drawback is its limited storage capacity. If you have an OTG pendrive, that won't be much of a headache either.Another big advantage worth mentioning is its juicy battery life. It is powered with a 3120mah battery which easily stays up to one and half days on normal usage.",8,1
B0117H62QK,5,"This is an amazing phone at the price-point by Mi. I am blown away by the display quality, the build quality and the beautiful UI. The cameras - both front and back are very very good too and produce quality images.The battery on moderate to heavy use easily lasts a day and a half.I was originally targeting a sub 10k phone and even ordered and received the Yureka Plus. That phone turned out to be garbage. It overheated, the battery drained and the display quality was poor compared to what was advertised. There were issues with Cyanogen as well. So, better sense prevailed and I returned it to Amazon after 2-3 days of painful use.When amazon reduced prices on all Mi devices by a 1000 I decided to stretch my budget a bit and pick it up. And boy am I glad that I did.This phone feels like a quality product in hand. Unlike, I am afraid to say Micromax or Yu devices (both of which I have owned), which feel flimsy and unreliable.I got this phone in yellow and the colour is beautifully mellow. Understated (despite being yellow!).A quality device. I'd recommend buying it without thinking twice if it is in your budget.Ps - I couldn't find too many normal camera images of the yellow coloured device when I was looking for them before buying, so am posting one here for others who might be looking.",26,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Do not buy mi products. Servece center behave of mi is full of tereable, abbusive, senseless replyies. I brought mi pad some few months back in Rs 10000 in offer, got some problem in touchscreen another all functions were working, I went to the service center they replied that you entered water in it and motherboard fully burnt and will not be repaired under warrenty and you have to pay 15000 for it. I asked if motherboard burnt then how the tab fully working and the price of new tab is 11000 now then 15000 for what. They replied we given you the answer now you think what to do we have nothing to do with that and we do not give you anything in writing. Finally I am going to consumer court. This problem is not only mine I seen many costomers facing same problem there and going to consumer forum.",8,1

B0117H62QK,1,"DO NOT BUY THIS.The phone was pretty much good at its first few months, but later I faced a huge lot of problems,when i visited to the MIUI forum I was shocked to find out that many others too had the problem and the Xiaomi had a poor service.THE PROBLEMS THAT I FACED AFTER TWO MONTHS WHERE-1)The secondary camera had pink dots on its image while shooting (why is a phone required without selfies).  link to forrum for this issue-[...]2)The overall sound of the mobile got reduced .

B0117H62QK,1,I did not like the phone. I had upgraded the phone to latest version as soon as I bought it but the issue was speaker sound was too harsh and loud and I feel like my ear is aching after the use of just 5 mins or so. Therefore I had given my phone to various people to use it and all of them had the same review.I am waiting for Amazon's tie-up with as I no longer trust Flipkart for online shopping and looking for buying Moto g3 from Amazon.,2,1
B0117H62QK,1,"The features maybe good, but honestly they have the worst service centers. Of the four people i know using this phone all face charging issues, touch screen issues and to top that their service centers are of the worst kind. Never are repairs done on time and the fault reappears within a week (at least in mine and friends case). And they never have spares at these service centers. my suggestion if u plan on replacing the phone in say 6 months and you want to waste ur hard earned money u can very well go ahead and buy it..  but after 6 months be sure that u will be required to have  regular appointment at the s***tiest service center i have ever seen..... a very very very disappointed customer who has learned that MI's business model revolves around selling in bulk, ignoring the defects in their goods and completely ignoring quality in service.",12,1
B0117H62QK,1,Ordered this phone on 15 oct and received it on 16th. Didn't have the patience of using the phone for more than few hours and requested a return by the same night. The phone gets overheated a lot and even when idle. I could not bear the heat for even a minute while talking. Yes! it's that bad. Updating the system to latest available level didn't help.Thanks to amazon for arranging speedy pick-up. I see that refund has been initiated.,2,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Worst phone ever bought. I got the phone today the phone looks nice. Used the phone 2 to 3 hours and found that the home button ia not responding to the touch.

B0117H62QK,1,"The worst phone I ever purchased in my life. I purchased this in Oct-2015 and within 2-3 months its started getting hanged and slow, still somehow IMi 4i (Grey, 16GB) managed to use it. Recently another issue with this phone is that this phones battery not getting charge with the charger, without charge of battery there is no use of any phone.Yesterday (21st Aug-16) I went to service station at Bodakdev-Ahmedabad where I see multiple customer with different complains in MI Phones. It was rush in service centre, there was no place to sit and waiting for all customers for almost 1 to 2 hours. This itself indicates that how often customer getting issues in this MI Phone. Even the customer service executives were very frustrated and were shouting to people like anything. My worst experience ever.When my turn came they asked me to keep my phone there for 15 days as the Part not available to them. Try to understand in todays generation what should a person do without phone for 15 days? Do a person buy new phone to manage in those 15 days? Still I decided to give my phone but when I asked for internal data security they told they are not taking any responsibility of Data hence its better to take data backup. When this charging Point is not working then how should a customer take data backup? Becaue from the same point we have to connect wire in computer for data backup.Overall not at all good experience with phone and service centre. Totally waste of money.If you want to go for MI phone make sure you have another good phone as a backup for this MI phone.",1,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Everything is fine untill screen breaks on its own. Not a bad phone but not durable. One fine day, you remove this from your pocket to see hairline cracks and touch stops working.

Try rebooting your device."" It had gone 10 days + since I bought this phone so Amazon rejected the replace order.I tried calling Mi support but they are just not listening and providing useless ideas to fix this issue.Do not know what to do.It is Amazon who irresponsibly providing platform to cheaters for cheating with our hard earned money.",55,1

I've upgraded the MIUI to latest immediately expecting the heating will be better handled but its not. Camera is excellent, if you are browsing or seeing Youtube and if you get a call immediately you can't attend the call due to heat its so hot. I am not sure if Xaomi planning for a future firmware release to address this. Simply by starting the phone itself you will fell the heat .The purpose of the phone is not met. May be you can use it as a gadget , Camera , gaming, youtube , ignoring the heat. This is a genuine review next day after receiving the phone.

There were no authorized service centers in Thrissur (Kerala) and after lot of hassles, sent the phone to their Cochin service center recently. They mentioned that the SIM slot has to be replaced and it will cost 6.5K (for a phone that I bought for 10K). When asked about the product warranty with them, they said they offer only service warranty and not product warranty, though the promo says that its comes 1-year manufacturing warranty.

B0117H62QK,5,"Excellent phone. Must buy. Gets heated up a lot but I've asked for a replacement, and hopefully the problem wont persist.Battery : Takes a long time to charge, but charge stays for around 24 hours with decent usage.Display : Best in class. Everything looks SO much better in HD display, my friends are all so envious of the display.Front cam : It says only 5 MP, but the photos taken are amazing.Back cam: Makes me wonder if I am using a DSLR. It's that good.Heating : Phone heats up a LOT but I've put a good back cover so I dont feel it much. Note, there is an update available which claims to reduce the heating problem.MIUI : The user interface is okay-ish. A little uncomfortable initially, but you can get used to it and then it will be decent enough.Volume : Speaker volume and quality is decent. But alarm volume is not very high.Memory : Only 16GB, but the user is left with around 10GB, which is good enough for any average person with 1000 photos and 2000 songs :P There might still be a few GB left over.Overall it's an excellent buy, a steal at this price. The display in (OP in gaming language) out of the world, and the cameras are both awesome. The memory limit doesn't really bother you much and an update is all it takes to get rid of the heating problem. Buy it blindly.",30,1

They asked to keep phone in service center for 15 days to replace parts, as parts are not available. 15 DAYS, seriously? Also, they don't give assurance that phone will be ready in 15 days.

B0117H62QK,1,The phone is only good if you want to show off a good specification and style. It regularly hangs and many application closes down on its own.

As i mentioned the product is good if you want to feel good for having phone with good specification but do not intend to use it. My suggestion invest more and get a better phone.,1,1

However,  i still went ahead with it as these issues have been reported to be countered by recent MIUI updates which regulate the processor performances to avoid overheating.The product came in well before delivery date and  did give out heating signs on first boot.  However, I quickly got the MIUI updated to the latest version and haven't experienced any heating ever since.All in all,  the phone is light, slim and gives out a premium vibe.

B0117H62QK,4,"Hi Guys,I'm writing this review for MI 4I. I bought this phone during mid Oct sale and have had a pleasant experience till now.Listing the things I liked the most :1)This  phone looks great in hand and is light on weight. The display is super with 1080 x 1920 pixels resolution.2) It is slim and has a poly carbonate back cover.3) I loved the User Interface designed for MI. The phone continued to amaze me with distinguishing feature. One hand touch, double tap and open  message from lock screen,swap camera by scrolling finger up/down,pocket lock,pinch zoom notifications etc to name a few.4) Camera quality is brilliant. I captured some pictures with back camera and with  One plus 2 camera. The picture quality was comparatively better in MI4I5) In comparison to other phones for same configuration , MI 4I is priced lessThings I didn't like :Heating issue- Though with the recent MI4i update,the heating issue is solved to great extent. So I won't complain more on this.Overall - Great buy. Great technology and innovation.",0,0

B0117H62QK,1,"On Aug 17, 2015 i purchased an Mi4i for my cousin ( Mr Shaju ) from Snapdeal . Last month, he mentioned to me some issue with battery backup and I suggested him to visit the service center. He Stays in Kochi and hence visited the Mi Service centre in Ravipuram, Kochi.The service center guys did something and gave him the phone back and charged him with Rs 230 since the warranty expired a month ago. He mentioned to me that the battery is working properly and started using the phone again.A day after that the phone began to overheat while he was using it and suddenly he threw the phone to the floor.I visited the same service center to realize that they cant do anything about it since its out of warranty and asked me to drop a mail.I wasn't aware of what the service center technicians did with the phone until they explained it to me that what they did was a software update.!!I am attaching all the pictures and copy of the documents needed for the proof, I would like to get a reply from you/your team as soon as possible on what should i do take this forward.To bring it to your attention, I saw another ""mi note"" exploded under warranty while visiting the service center.",0,0
B0117H62QK,4,"Its been almost an year since I purchased this phone. I had bought this for around 8500(thanks to the great Indian shopping days offer and citibank cashback). For that price this is an absolute bargain. Let me get down to the specifics now.Display : The best feature of this phone is its stunningly sharp display (441 ppi I guess). The colors pop out and the letters are crisp. Has decent sunlight readability and the viewing angles are great.Camera : This according to me is the second best feature of this phone, the images are not over saturated, the details are ample and the ""HDR"" mode is impressive (it just pumps up the saturation and contrast TBH.) I have used quite a lot of Smartphone cameras and this is among the decent ones. You can proudly flaunt the pictures taken with this phone.Style and Build : It may not be a unique design but it surely is sleek and stylish. The build is sturdy, I have dropped the device more than 10 times and yet it lives to this day. It is not your average budget mobile design, not may people would hate the looks of this.Performance : Snapdragon 615 processors were exclusively made for budget devices and you can definitely feel it when you use this device. There is 2 GB of physical memory that is enough for any phone to pull off day to day tasks without giving you making you yawn. (BTW I am not a big fan of phones with 4+ GB of memory, there is no point in having that much of RAM, some macbooks only have 4 GB and they perform really well). I have played dead trigger 2, Asphalt 8 and many other games without any stutter. multitasking is not a problem as well. Google chrome lags at times though (this is where I miss some RAM)Calling and Contacts : The dialler and contacts app are comprehensive, no problems here. The call quality is excellent, no abrupt network issues.Software : Here it comes, MIUI has garnered quite a few fans in India as well, as far as I know it is one of the most refined and practical skins ever paired with Android OS. There are a lot of features like app permissions, security center and what not. The room for customization is ample and the experience is premium. But that's not the whole story (will come to that later on)Battery : The battery lasts for 12-15 hours with moderate usage. The phone will die in about 8-10 hours with heavier use and you certainly cannot watch two bollywood movies while connected to the internet.What I did not like : MIUI is an absolute RAM eater, about 20% of the RAM usage of your phone will be due to MIUI and related apps so be ready for that. Also XIAOMI is clearly not keen in providing the latest version of Android to its users, I dont understand their obsession with keeping on updating MIUI while most of the users are waiting for the newer version of Android. Older devices like A7000 have get 6.0 but we are still here stuck with the lollipop. If you are interested in having the newer version of android in your device stay away from MI devices, you probably would find your solace in Moto.FInal Words : XIAOMI can certainly do better and so can you, this is not the best you will get for the price tag but, this is as VFM as it can get.Sorry for the long post!",0,0
B0117H62QK,1,"Never buy any phone from this cheap Chinese manufacturer. MI phones are bound to fail within a year. I purchased 2 MI phones and both of them failed within 1 year. The first phone failed within a month of purchase and the second one failed within 11 months of purchase. More importantly Xiaomi has pathetic after sale service in India. They have very few service centers in India and the people at service center and customer care executives are just ignorant. Navigation keys of my Mi4i phone stopped working suddenly one fine morning. I restarted the phone several times but nothing worked. So finally I decided to go to service center. The service center executive did not do any inspection and told me that they needed 2 weeks to repair the phone as they did not have spare parts available. He said he will call me when the mobile is ready. I never got any call from them for 1 and half months and they did not even receive my call when I called them. So I lodged 2 complaints with MI customer care. These people are really interesting. They just kept on telling me to wait for 24 hours, 48 hours etc. whenever I called them to inquire about the status. Finally after 3 months when I called the service center, they picked my phone and thank god, the phone was repaired. So the moral of the story is; NEVER EVER BUY Xiaomi PHONES. For that matter any cheap Chinese phone.",0,0

B0117H62QK,5,"I bought the white Mi4i and what a marvellous piece of art it is. In the below review, I will stick to only a few points where a new buyer would want clarity. I have been using it for a week now.About the software:The icing on the cake is Xiaomi's own software (UI) which provides options galore for the control freak. At every stage, there is an option for whatever you want to do there. Cant get more intuitive than this. Permissions given to individual apps can be controlled. Actions that would take several clicks on any other android phone can be achieved in just one or two. Even the screen size can be altered for one-handed use with just a swipe.About the hardware:The dimensions of the phone are just excellent. Very thin, very light, very balanced. With a thin bexel, it does not feel wide. It can easily be held in one hand. The outer polycarbonate body is not damage-proof as some videos might suggest.  The white shell is also very slippery in the hand. This phone needs a case (I suggest the Nillkin rubberised case from Amazon).About the heating problem:There is no heating problem when used normally. I have done everything with this except gaming. And the warmth generated is very mild.About the radiation problem:Even though the radiation levels are well within Indian specifications, this phone is among those with higher radiation levels. Better to use good ear-phones for long use.About the camera:The camera is excellent. But video-recording in full HD produced less than optimum results.Battery: For me, the battery lasts a day and half with about an hour of talktime but with almost continuous use of wifi for browsing and downloading files.Overall an emphatic 'buy' rating for the price.",0,0
B0117H62QK,4,"I have bought this product during holidays for INR 9999. Product delivered perfectly on time as promised. Now after using this mobile for 1 month, here's my review:Pros:(1) Camera quality is real good.(2) If you are ok with custom skin, then MIUI will be fantastic for you. I have updated to MIUI 7 and it has improved my phone's performance a tad.(3) I have installed two-three heavy games, they run without glitch so far.(4) Phone is light and slick and easy to hold in your hand.Cons:(1) Heating problem is there, if you take simultaneous 10-15 photos, phone heats up, but it cools down fast and for normal usage you can manage with the heating. But if you are an all-time gamer or all-time talker then probably it's not for you.(2) The sound quality can be much better, the microphone is ok but speaker quality can be much improved.Overall verdict:If you are looking for a mobile for a specific purpose (Gaming/Photo/Music), then it's not for you. It's a cheap phone for average user. And it's absolutely value for money if I get 15% discount on INR 9999 because of HDFC card in future.

I liked Samsung A7 but it had old processor and lesser battery and nexus 5p which was sadly was a single sim device, I was initially skeptical about Mi products but since I was in an urgent need i ordered it through next day delivery. And i am glad i choose this, right from day 1 I liked it. primary camera is way good with quick autofocus, exposure control and even manual mode. Secondary cam is a selfie expert, it smothens, lightens and does everything automatically to make your selfies look good. Performance is also good, some minor lags due to the heavy UI.

It's sleek design and sturdiness screen has gorilla glass .I had dropped it without cover and screen guard but phone sustained without any damage2. Smart themes really love few3. It's smooth and fast . the phone has never hung since 1 month. It's 2gb ram and processor is awesome3. Camera is mind blowing with HDR quality option. Even front camera is smart and photos are awesome.4. Speaker and sound quality upto mark5. Mi cloud storage is added optionCons1. No SD card slot .but you can manage with 32 GB internal.memory2. No flash for front camera. Truly speaking you don't require one the image quality is good enough even in dark.3. Battery back up is average although it's 3060 mah . but phone charges very fast.4.It does gets heated up fast but its not very troublesome.Overall I really liked this phone and would recommend to buy if you are bored with Samsung HTC Sony.

B0117H62QK,4,"The phone comes in completely sealed box so no issue of phone to be refurbished.The delivery was quick.Talking about the phone, it is a great value for the price that you pay. I've been using it since 4 days and I'm delighted by the performance of this phone.All heavy games and multitasking flows smoothly and does not lag, so the ram and the processor does its job efficiently. Though phone gets heated, but its very rare and theres no serious heating issues as other reviewers has exaggerated of it getting heated like an iron press. So don't worry about it and just go for it.Taking about the camera , it really captures great snaps even in dark. I've also compared its picture quality with nexus 5's camera and I found  that mi4i 's snaps were comparable to that of nexus 5 and at night mi4i captured better quality image than nexus. Front camera too has stunning capture capabilities. Also it has dual tone led flash light which is more brighter.Display is also awesome.Battery lasts for one full day(normal use_internet_casual gaming)So don't think too much,if this phone fits in your budget you should definitely go for it because at this price, this is the best you can get....",0,0

B0117H62QK,4,"I'm writing this review after 2 months of intense usage of Mi 4i. I realised it's worth for 10000 only. Not more than that.  I got it for 8500 on big billon day.  Yes,  it has heating issue only if your internal memory is full.  So consider your memory as 9GB internal.  Don't cross this limit otherwise you may feel that you kept a heater inside your pocket.I have figured out,  the default  E-mail app is not good.  At some point you may feel it's cheap product.  But it performs nice. Trust me,  the display quality is very rare at this price.  All other phones have a stupid display specially lenovo and micromax.  Mi gives you amazing display.The second point is the call quality. Its really wonderful. The call reception and micro phone is awesome in Mi4i.  Which is truly horrible in other phones specially in Lenovo products.Fast charging and battery life is excellent.  And if you are not a sort of heavy user,  it performs better than you expect.",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,"Loved the phone.... Was in great dilemma after seeing all the negative customer reviews (heating, call drop, call quality ,battery etc. etc.) on nearly all sites. Still I liked the look and spec of the mobile. Somehow I made up my mind that I ll take a chance. The main turning point was that it is available on Amazon ( mobile was delivered to me in exact 15 hrs after ordering - marvellous). It was only because i had lot of confidence on Amazon ( and its return policy to be specific) i bought it from Amazon and not any other e-tailer. The phone proved my expectation correct - fantastic looks , great performance , superb call clarity , well thought music player, superb camera quality and the great and stunning sunlight display. Good phone at a great price.",43,1

B0117H62QK,5,"After spending a year with the Redmi 1S, I was completely in love with Xiaomi products! Bought this one because the 1S was running out of battery and memory quickly. This upgrade has definitely been worth it. I don't face any memory or battery issues now, and the phone is so totally awesome :) It's very light weight and slim and doesn't come pre-installed with any bloatware software, that's why I love MIUI because the features baked-in are power packed. The other problem I faced with the 1S was video recording and audio quality, which have completely gone away with the 4i. It's been one month now since I've had this phone, and I am more than happy with it plus I'm a very satisfied Amazon customer because I got this phone for Rs.1000 less. This phone reminds me a lot of my old iPhone 4S, with a very similar look and feel, which I was so relieved to let go of. My advice to you: If you're looking for a budget flagship phone, THIS IS IT!! Look no further, #MiFan over and out.",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,I was afraid to buy this phone after reading the negative feedback and after 3 days I did not remove the sticker from the phone to keep it testing for all my uses. Now its been 3 days since I am using this phone and its worth the money I spend .What you need to do : as soon as you receive the phone update the updates for it. After that the heating problem solved as well as freed memory upto 1gb at 1st it was just 500mb. Will be writing rest after 2-3 month.,5,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Mi4i: Don't ever think to buy this cheap chinese phone or any other phone from this manufacturer - MI / Xiaomi. Their devices as well as their service centre and customer support is the worst in the world. I got this on 01/Sept/15 from Amazon - suddenly a month back in July 1st week - the phone is not able to receive the network coverage at all in both slots - tried different SIMs from different operators. My handset is submitted to service center from last 25 days - the rude and incompetent service center person says it's motherboard issue and motherboard needs to be replaced when I went to the service center 10 days back they are saying parts are not available. extremely pathetic service by MI India (TVS Eletronics - Shivaji Nagar, Pune). The MI service center has daily about 500 customers queued up due to consistent issues with their xiaomi handsets. Just Google for MI Service Center issues and you would get an idea why not to buy any phone from this chinese company.",0,0
B0117H62QK,2,"1. It a sleek looking handset with practically no grip, expect it to slip out of your hand every now and then which might lead to screen cracks. (rather  add few bucks and buy a better phone than spend on repairs).2. Bluetooth - It has some problem with connecting with my car Bluetooth. It keeps getting disconnected every now and then. thankfully this doesn't happen during calls. when i reported this to the service center they changed the OS saying the existing OS version in not stable. The difference it made is the frequency of getting disconnected has reduced. (all other phones work seamlessly with my car Bluetooth)3. Auto closure of Apps - Of the very few apps i have downloaded, FB is one. It has a tendency of hanging abruptly and you get a message that the app is not responding.4. It certainly has a few positives in the form of a good camera and good overall specs.  Would seriously suggest to evaluate options before closing the deal.",0,0

B0117H62QK,4,"Current MIUI Version: MIUI 6.6.10| StableI'm writing this review to share my experience on Xiaomi Mi4i after 2 Months of Usage.I'm a medium user with no serious gaming. I multitask a lot and here's is my genuine review:Pros:[+] Very Light weight and slim with premium looks. It feels great in holding in hand. The build quality is also great.[+] You can easily use with one hand.[+] 1080p FHD Display is one of the best displays employed in the 10k-20k range smartphones. The colour reproduction isexcellent.[+] Excellent 5 MP Front Camera 13 MP Rear Camera. The photos are sharp and vivid enough.[+] After the 6.6.6 Update, we get 1 GB RAM free out of 2 GB RAM. No issues or lags with multitasking.[+] The Quickcharge v2.0 feature is very handy and helps us to charge the 3030 mAh battery fast.[+] With the latest  updates, the battery stands for 2 Days with casual usage. At heavy usage, it lasts a whole day. Sothe battery seems great for a normal usage.[+] MIUI v6 is wonderful to use and has lots of features. Also the OTG, Sunlight Display and Other Sensors works well.[+] The Smart Flip Cover makes it grip to hold and also adds protection to device without adding bulkiness. The Sleep Wakesensor also works fine.Cons:[-] As you heard in all reviews, YES, the phone does heats under gaming. But under normal usage, it DOES not heat. Theheating issue may be due to Snapdragon 615 chipset. But after the cover was put on, i barely noticed heating. So dont getdown with the ""heating"" if you are not a gamer.[-] Expandable storage may be an issue for some users, but i'm happy with the 16 gigs. Also the OTG helps us if we want tostore any large files.*Please understand that Xiaomi is working hard in giving updates for this phone and rectifying bugs. This is evident fromthe fact that after my purchase i got frequent updates: 6.5.6 -> 6.6.1 -> 6.6.2 -> 6.6.6->6.6.10(Latest). So dont worry, ithink the phone will be updated with a stable rom soon.*The MIUI forum is very helpful for understanding the new developments and also to clear our doubts regarding the phone.ADVICE: Please do a FACTORY RESET after an update. This will fix all the issues.  Also Try to use original Mi accessories to retain its looks.FINAL VERDICT: The Mi4i definitey is a strong competer in the sub 15K segment with lot of stellar features includingDisplay, Camera etc but having issues of heating under gaming. So for a casual to medium user who wants an overall bestuser experience, Mi4i is a great device to look for. For gamers, stay away from this Device.RATING: 4/5",4,1

B0117H62QK,4,Firstly I would like to thank  amazon for its faster delivery services.Now  coming to the device ..Picture quality of the camera is awesome and good in low light as well.I would strongly recommend to buy a case cover to protect phone from falling from your hand as the back body of the mobile is so soft and even though I updated it to MIUI 6 heating still persisted. Whenever I  use headphones and remove them the headphone symbol is still seen and disappears only after some time.After closing high end games like asphalt 8 and other high end apps a  blue screen blinks and  disappears.. Hope this may be  lost in further updates.. And coming to price it is suggest able to buy  if you wish to taste Xiaomi's technology and I insist on updating the mobile to decrease the heating of the device.Charging time of the mobile is less that's a good one,0,0

B0117H62QK,4,Good mobile Worth for money.... Performance is also good.... I bought on plus 2 and MI 4i. Mi4i front camera is more better than One plus 2. Touch response and display is awesome... Main drawback is heating problem i am facing more heating problem while speaking in phone and play games. I  am aware of it before buying but heating problem is higher than i expected. Storage capacity is less but u can make use of MI cloud facility. It takes more time to charge while connected to PC but u can charge in power socket it take only decent time. I bought it for Rs.9999 with Rs. 1500 Cashback so actual price is Rs.8500. If your are not bothered about heating issue and storage space u can go for it. Please dont compare this high end mobiles. Please compare this with mobiles with this price range.,0,0
B0117H62QK,1,"Frankly speaking the phone is not good.Reasons.....1.Out of 2gb Ram u only get 700 mb in idle condition.  R u kidding Xiaomi?2.software is not polished.3. Laggy processor. Not good for gaming. I wonder how snapdragon 615 octacore is so Laggy? My honor 4c performance is far better.  It has 1.2 GHz Kirin processor,  but it performs excellent in games like NOVA 3 and Relic Run.4. Camera quality not upto the expectations. Compared to honor 4c with same 13 MP cam,  mi4i gives blurred image and having dual tone flash not powerful than honor 4c.5. Finally coming to memory,  it gives you only 10,7 gb of storage rather than mentioned 12 gigs.  So be aware. Plus don't buy this product.The only good thing is sun light display and slim,  light weight.  That's it.Thank you for your patience.",4,1
B0117H62QK,3,"Okay so I've been using Mi4i for the past two and half months and my overall experience with the him has been somewhat mixed. I would neither call it a great device nor a crappy one. It's just about okay. Phone's looks don't disappoint but performance kinda does. It gets hot and performs somewhat sluggishly if you use it at a stretch for say 20 minutes or so. And that's not good. It's camera is okay, not as exceptional as some overzealous gadget reviewers make it out to be. It just about does the job. That said the display of Mi4i is excellent and the feel of the device is premium for sure. Sound quality is decent too if you pair it with good quality headphones. For those still considering this phone, well...don't. Look for something else. I'm stuck with this for at least a year ;-)",0,0

B0117H62QK,1,"Dear All,i bought this phone in November 2015 and this is absolute waste of money. PLEASE DONT BUY MI AT ALL.only after 6 months my phone is not working!!!! it is not getting charged!!!!!Absolute waste of money. DOnt even think of buying",1,1
B0117H62QK,2,"Switched back to my iPhone in just three months of usage. Anyone experimenting platforms will have to suffer anxiety and loss of money too.Is cheap to begin with, but iPhone users might as well invest a bit more and stay on iOS.There are some features like Perpetual Call Log, and caller wise call summary (that too perpetual) which was interesting. Imagine having a log for all calls made to a particular contactBut the annoying keypad which just would not perform even a anywhere closer to iPhone made me switch back. With my iPhone 5S, I am now typing out my emails and blogs with ease.Camera in comparison to iPhone would fall to impress. And the recent price drop on iPhone 5s to under 20k (dec2015) makes it an imperative buy.",0,0
B0117H62QK,3,My rating is only for the great spec  but not usefull because i have 7 days experience in this phone .i found 2 major problm in this mi4i phone.1  .

B0117H62QK,1,"As winter was near i thought i should buy a new heater. But i found every heater was big in size and can carry it around everywhere. So i asked one of my friends, he told me about xiaomi mi4i, i thought he was joking its so small in size, how can it give me heat. He convinced me to try it once. So i thought to give it a try, and why not its small in size and can fit in your pocket. So i Ordered this one. And guys it far more good then my expectations. It really gives so much heat that you won't even need to wear sweater in the winter. And its plus point is it is smart and it has a display and also work as a mobile phone. Who wouldn't buy a Heater which also works as mobile phone. I am happy to have this. Thank you Amazon for your great service and thank you Xiaomi for making a great Smart Heater.",4,1
B0117H62QK,1,"it's getting hanged within a week,  and sometime its not getting charged, please don't buy this phone.. Company stated that 16 GB internal memory but have got only 9GB rest are already full with the application loaded by company so there is no 16 GB internal memory",1,1
B0117H62QK,1,I purchased the phone on 19th Feb.2016. Phone was defective from day 1. I gave to service for repair. They say whole display has to be replaced. Phone is lying in service for more than one month. I do not know what to do. Do not buy MI product. This is a bad company.,5,1

B0117H62QK,5,"I have been using this phone for close to a year and its a big hit for me.  I would say MI4I is just amazing.  I was very tentative before purchasing since there was too much noise about phone heating up and also some one said we can prepare an omlet on this phone.  I picked up as I got this for 8.5k after cashback and Amazon discount.  You wont get a phone with so many features at 8.5k so took a chance.  To be very honest, this phone is worth every penny.  Picture clarity, screen resolution, performance and response all too good.  Phone do get heated if you watch videos for a while.  This happens with every phone.  I have spoken upto 20 mins in one go and no heating up.  So I would say this phone is excellent and value for money.  Go for it...",0,0
B0117H62QK,1,"Typical chinese junk!! you buy it, you had it? its purely a luck game. 1.since day one don't fiddle with it aggressively. 2. let the phone season for few days. use for normal calls and normal photos and video. 3. let it charge and discharge for few days. 4. don't download filthy apps from net for few days. 5. go for mi updates, enable it . 6. until unless you are a expert never flash the built in software. BOTTOM LINE IT'S A WELL BUILT BUDGET PHONE. IF TI WORKS NOTHING TO WORRY IT WILL LAST FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IF IT GOES BAD?? LIKE ALL CHINESE JUNK NEVER BREAK YOUR HEAD FOR REPAIR, JUST THROUGH IT TO THE GARBAGE AND BUY SOME OTHER PHONE.YOU WON'T GET SPARES IN OPEN MARKET! ITS A COMPANY LIKE ""SELL AND FORGET"".

B0117H62QK,5,"Awesome Phone, Worth Buying.Got it for Dhanteras Sale at 9,999 and an additional cashback of 15%.Following are the factors which I liked it so much after using it for an week now.1. Super Cool Display which is crystal clear2. MI UI looks beautiful - Home Screen customization options, Color adjustment of notification lights, One Hand mode, etc.,3. Camera both front and back is really good4. Design of the Phone is really good, with slim and outer body looks really cool.Initially when the phone is switched on for the first time, it lags (was slow in opening apps), but it is faster after a restart.Phone heats up when playing games continuously for an hour or so, but it is manageable.",0,0

My phone well covered with mobile cover and having screen guard. The worst part is,it has not dropped anywhere nor hit with any object but still found screen broken from front camera side and touch screen is not working now. I can say quality is worse and do not recommend to go with. Now after visiting service center, they asking INR 4500/- to replace the screen, whereas i bought this phone in INR 10,000/- approx so this product didn't justify the value for money.I do not suggest any one to go with mi4i as per my experience.",4,1

XIAOMI needs to do a lot of optimization to get it running smoothly. Will update this section after the MIUI 7 update.Highly recommend the flip cover from the MI store for Rs.500.The phone is good enough for Rs.8500 (HDFC cash back offer).Do I recommend this phone?NO FOR Rs.13000, but for 10K, you need to consider it as an option.Amazon delivery was on time and the package was well put together.",0,0

Otherwise the mobile is good.The camera quality is very good. A photo taken at 8pm (no more sun around) of a person beside a fountain gets you a very clear picture of the person and the fountain (infact u can see the water threads very clearly).

B0117H62QK,5,"Brilliant product. Probably the best Xiaomi product after Mi 3, I have used. UI is a bliss and it has spoilt me to no end. I cannot upgrade to Samswine or Crapple or HTC now. Once you use this MIUI, there is no point of return. Beware, it is actually a warning. After using Mi 3, upgraded to S5 Galaxy and boy what a dumbed down UI TouchWiz is. Complete douche! MIUI is far more intelligent, it senses what you are gonna do. Copying a number from website, will prompt you if you wanna dial it. Running benchmarks, it will prompt you to switch to performance mode to increase best benchmark performance...damn how much I missed these, can't tell you. Happy to be a Xiaomi owner!",4,1
B0117H62QK,3,"When I received this phone, it was working well while within 2 days its front camera gave up working properly. I could see pink pixels flashing when I was using the front camera. Rest all the things were working fine. So, basically it was hardware defect. I went to Xiaomi service centre and got it fixed though. It was in warranty so I got this done for free.Overall, it is an amazing phone and I believe a defective product was delivered to me. Now its working really well and I love it. I would suggest people to buy it from offline stores and check it first or if you are buying from online store also then make sure you have warranty.Phone is nice. Grab it but with precaution. :)",0,0

B0117H62QK,4,"Hi,  I have brought this product from Amazon for 9999 /-  Rs.If you are a rational consumer and wants to buy a value for money product and your price range is in between 10,000 /- to 13,000 /- then you should prefer this phone.Before Mi 4i,  I have used Mi3, Red Mi 1s, Red Mi Note &  Lenovo A6000+ but frankly speaking this is very good phone in terms of Built Quality, Looks,  Camera,  Display, User Interface & Performance.The one and only drawback is its limited memory option in 16 GB variant you can get only 10.45 GB free which is too low for some users.If low memory has a problem then i prefer go for 32GB variant or wait for Mi 4c.ThanksRahul Gupta",0,0

MIUI is a big letdown. 1 GB ram is taken up by OS itself. Hardly any room for high-performance  app usage.Another big minus is MIUI update. while Google has already released marshmallow OS, Xiaomi released MIUI 7 recently with underlying OS as android Kitkat .This basically means you can't have latest google features of the latest OS(lollipop, marshmallow) in the near future.If you are not a heavy app user and want to have the good camera and display, Go for it.

Now I developed speaker issues, the speaker is connected to the sensors, so only speaker can't b changed, it needs to changed vt the sensor, which again cost u a lot.Although it has a good interface and software facility cheap hardware spoils the show.Cherry on the cake is no service centre is there, so any vendor will charge his own quote.O strongly recommend not to buy this phone.

I dropped my other phones before many times, but this is the first time screen of a phone broke. I personally know others for whom also the screen broke very easily. If you search online you will see many reviews complaining about this. About the functionality of the phone, it is quite average.

The speaker grill at the back is not having any stereo speakers rather just a single speaker, which can be easily tested by placing your finger on half side of the grill and then playing any music.

It hangs every time. If you anything for more than 2 minutes it's get heated. Then I request replacement which was accepted by Amazon and replaced within 2 days. But having same issue. I don't use for playing any games even not installed a single game till date. Even using basic stuffs it gets heated. Not sure am I having bad luck or something wrong with the xiaomi.,0,0
B0117H62QK,4,The phone is very good with a nice bright screen and good response. The battery life also seems to be quite decent.Only issue is of internal storage of only 16GB of which only 10.75 GB is available to user. So keep this point in mind before buying it.The packaging was good and delivery was fast. Only issue was Amazon advertised that there was cash back of 15% on HDFC+ app but I was not able to make payment multiple times in spite of having a valid debit card and balance in account. I got no intimation from bank on why payment failed. It would be good if Amazon can give an explanation on why payment failed from their side.,0,0

B0117H62QK,5,Good one for the price on offer.  I am not a smartphone geek but loved this device for the utility value. Decent display. Very responsive touch. Memory is not expandable.

Signal strength on my device is better than other devices at home (not sure if this is good or bad :-P ).

Those who won't need an external memory card. Also coz the camera quality of this phone is the best for any phone for this price. It beats all the Samsung cameras any day. If you can put in a little more money you can go in for the Mi4 which has a camera that's even better than the mi4i. Also the battery lasts pretty long and the phone looks good.

As an year long  happy user of Mi3, I was more biased towards Xiomi product, went ahead to buying Mi4i and thats where I made a MISTAKE. Apart from looks Mi4i is very poor compared to my old Mi3 in almost all areas.Pros (all same as Mi3):-  Camera - almost same as Mi3 or marginally better.- Screen quality- battery life- Gorilla Glass - not available in most of the phone in this price range and it was must for me.Cons- ITS A HEATER -  with a 15-20 minutes of wifi use like simple browsing or doing WA, it heats up like anything from top. You can not take call till you lock the phone and wait for 2 mnts.  If you take calls you will surely burn your ears like I did :(. i googled this and found that  almost 70% of Mi4i users are facing this issue. Xiomi has provided the upgrade claims to fix the issue, I did that 800+ MB of upgrade even after that its heating and i don't see much improvement in the problem.- Slower - I feel its bit slower than K3 note that  my brother has and I feel even Mi3 was better than this phone when it comes to responsiveness.I am a  basic user who use phone for WA, browsing and reading. I don't do gaming much just played subway surfer and was ok with its response but again it was heating after 10-15 of play so can say its not for Gamers or heavy user for sure.Bottom line: I would not recommend this phone to anyone, heating is a MAJOR issue for me and makes this phone unusable.",3,1
B0117H62QK,5,"First thing first.... this has been an amazing phone  by leaps and bounds at this price point frm other phones... i bought it at 9999....thanks to Amazon..... but i am yet to get my 15% Cashback  amazon had promised if paid through  HDFC card... am reviewing this after two months of use....the best thing about this phone is its eye candy looks and flawless performance....Pros:1) build quality top notch... personally i like unibody design  bcs it feels the device is compact and sturdy.2)Camera awesome specially front camera....there were some glitches initially but after updating miui it is performing superbly without any lag3)vibrant display with excellent viewing angle.... one thing should be noted that it has sunlit display... so u dnt hv to worry if u use it outdoor under bright sun...4) MIUI... the custom rom on top of Android is superb... i love it... u dont hve to use third party security app... it is there inbuilt....a lot of other feature is infused... i suggest u update ur miui regularly.... preferably use beta version.... u will get new features more often....5) Sound quality is good ... but with headphones it produces excellent sound..6) Double tap to wake up screen feature is very useful.Cons:1)  No expandable memory card... there is only about 12 gb usable memory... though otg support is there.2) front speaker could be on the level of the screen... it is down... so dust could be stored there.3)Battery performance is average... i expected better..In conclusion, I suggest go for this device if u want a budget phone with excellent features... U will love it.",3,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Mi4i: Don't ever think to buy this cheap chinese phone. Their devices as well as their service centre and customer support is the worst in the world. I got this on 22/Oct/15 from Amazon, and within first 15 days I started experiencing heavy call drop problem. I contacted Xiaomi for replacement but they denied and asked me to submit my handset to service center. Since I didn't had any other choice I need to submit it to service center, they returned it back to me after 15-20 days after changing its motherboard. When I started my phone again and inserted SIM card in both SIM1 and SIM2 slots, there was no network at all, I need to revisit service center again and they said its motherboard needs to be replaced again. They have again repalced the same and gave it back to me. I felf some sound coming out of the handset now, I re visted service center again and asked them to open in front of me, they did and found that 1 screw was missing and they very easily replied that engineer might have missed the screw by mistake but the sound was still there, they said you can get your motherboard replaced once again if not satisfied. When I again tried to insert SIM card into both the SIM slots, still no network.Can anyone imagine a smartphone without network, you tell me what to do with this cheap mobile now.Be ware of this local mobile company, its better to get Freedom 251 rather than this one.",3,1
B0117H62QK,5,"This was a replacement for my iPhone 5 but no worries. The change from Apple to Android went smoothly (see my blog: https://goo.gl/1zdgHe). It's a very easy to use and I figured out most of the functions with the help a couple of youtube videos. I'm no techie but i use this phone a lot (read about that at https://goo.gl/6jpeyR), and I found no lagging or heating while watching videos though it crashed once while shooting a video. Battery lasts till night if there is no heavy use. The phone is also quite light and sleek - I put on an aluminium bumper case to protect it without adding too much weight.One issue. There was no headset in the box so I had to buy the Mi in-earphones from the Mi Store for Rs 999. Not too bad as I got the phone itself for Rs 9999. In fact, I was so impressed by Xiaomi that I bought the Mi Band too for Rs 799.However my wife was a bit worried about my wearing the band 24/7. So I did some research, and was surprised to find that the mobile industry is hiding the fact that its electromagnetic waves may be damaging our DNA and causing other health issues. So I blogged about that too. But that's another story (https://goo.gl/9rZqzH)",3,1

B0117H62QK,5,"I've been using Mi 4i (Grey) for 2.5 weeks now. I haven't had any issues so far.What I like about this phone:1. The Camera- one of the reasons I bought this phone is the 5MP front camera. My previous phone's selfie quality sucked so bad I could barely recognise myself. The back camera has a two-tone flash which is something I've wanted for a long time.2. The display: It has by far the best display! Even phones worth 30k don't have such a crystal clear display.3. Smooth interface- I play a lot of games and not once has this phone hanged or even lagged. Absolutely smooth UI experience. Way surpassed my expectations.4. Sleek but sturdy- this phone has the looks of a supermodel with the strength of a bull. Need I say more?5. Battery- I listen to a LOT of music, play a LOT of games and window shop on Amazon A LOT and still this beast doesnt give up! Also I've to charge it for lesser time than my old phones (Xperia & Moto E) .6. Super-fast internet, even WiFi works better. Saves me a lot of time.What I dislike about this phone:1. What is with the ""no memory card slot"" trend? Why? JUST WHY?? I don't like OTG, it's not convenient for me. So I rely completely on the internal memory :(2. No headphones :-/ Thankfully, I bought a pair of JBL last month so that's not a issue for me. But i'd heard that Mi earphones have a kickass sound quality and was eager to try them out but alas! Shelling out an extra 500 -1000bucks for headphones AFTER having paid almost 13k for this phone irks me.3. Overheating- not really an issue since it happens to all phones. I use it continuously for hours together and I'd be rather worried if it didn't heat up :POverall- GO FOR IT! THE best for under 15k. Spend a little extra on the headphones and memory and it's still totally worth it. I'm so glad I bought it.",32,1

B0117H62QK,5,"This is one of the best phones i have ever used.i bought a 32gb version from MI site but i am writing this review here as some people are misleading by adding negative reviews. to be honest this is an amazing phone bang on for the price offered.1. Heating: this phone gets just a little warm not too much i have used this phone for a week now even 3 days on the previous version. it just gets warm, stop calling it a heater or stuff , a power packed phone will get this warm if you find it too hot better buy some samsung or nokia 101 because that is what is suited for you like how can you not expect a a octa core phone to heat this much.2. Lagging: there is no lag in this phone at all. miui is heavy but the ram is optimized enough to let you have a lag free experience.3. Miui needs to be studied well before you know all the features, so stop complaining about things missing everything is well perfect just explore the setting properly.4.Sound: sound is little low but i found it normal not too low and that is not a deal breaker at all.The phone is the best in this range: perfect camera, perfect looks and perfect experience.Those complaining about only 9 gb available guys every phone having 16gb internal will offer only 9-10gb so flipkart or mi is not misleading you, you are just dumb and not entitled to buy a smart phone.In my opinion you should buy this phone without thinking at all don't think about the bad reviews it is a must buy and trust me you will love it :Dif you feel low on storage get a 32gb version.the only problem is a litle low sound but that can be managed. So stop getting misleaded by negative reviews this is by far the best phone in this range",18,1

B0117H62QK,5,Awesome phone. Great service by amazon. Fastest free delivery. Mi 4i is superb phone in this price range. Realy u will enjoy. Just blindly go for it. I purchsed 3 mi products from amazon sellor is e-mobiles. Very good seller. Best value for money. It is a monster phone. Very simple to use but fastest phone in avg price range.dont know what is hang in this phone lol.But if u are searching for the best ear phone for mi 4i. Then browse mistore given in ur phone and buy mi in ear head phone just @999.this is the place where u get the genuine ear phone for mi. In other shopping site it is fake. Still maximum ear phone support it. But mi in ear earphone is realy awsome at least way better then sanheiser and sony and skulcandy and jbl in the range till 2500.it is realy cheap and best. The sound effect and bass awsome. I compared it with others and took risk to buy it cz less coments are there for its in ear earphone. But realy it is the best of best to my mi 4i.even it is working with other devices. Love it,2,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Let's talk the obvious first-- I am huge fan of Amazon. ""No one"" comes close to what amazon can do. Period.Now the real issue: I bought Mi4i in October 3rd week. It got swiftly delivered in a day (since I paid for 1 day guaranteed delivery). But the it reached me, I had to urgently leave for Jharkhand for family reasons. The amazon package was yet to be opened.I arrived at Mumbai yesterday. When I tried switching on my Mi4i, it didn't. I thought maybe the battery would have died. So I plugged it to charge throughout the night (one thing I noticed all this while was that 'the Mi logo kept flashing all the time' but nothing further happened. I tried switching on several time. But nothing worked.Knowing Amazon will easily take care of this like it always does, I called them up complaining about the ""faulty"" product I was accidentally sent. However they refused a replacement as ""10 days replacement guarantee is over"". One thing they fail to understand that the product was "" defective "" since the Beginning. That Amazon shipped me a faulty phone.P.S. the phone is in brand new condition. Let alone using, it's the first time i have touched it.",2,1
B0117H62QK,5,"I have bought Mi 4i in Amazon sale and got it in less than 9k.It is an excellent phone and best at this price. I have been using it for over 3 months and didn't had any major issue.Pro's- This Phone has the best camera in Price range until 20-25k. Though I had even used Galaxy S3,  S4 and Nexus 5 but it's camera beats many of the phones even in higher Price Range.MiUi7 - Clean and very Elegant. There are numerous awesome Themes available to be downloaded. These are of course the best advantage of using a mi phone.Battery - even with continued data usage, 3-4hours of talk time and multiple running apps I get over a day of battery power which is greatApart from these,  there are no major lags, the display is brilliant and being very thin it looks very elegant.As is the problem with octacore 610 snapdragon processors,  the phone gets hot after continuous use. Sometimes it hangs when doing heavy multi tasking.Overall I recommend this is the best phone at 10k price range.",2,1
B0117H62QK,5,"After my try out with multiple phones, I decided to give a shot with Xiaomi phone and chosen Mi4i. Before purchasing it I was suffering with following issues with my older phones that I was hating to meet again in a newer phone.1. Proximity sensor issues [Faced with Lumia 520, Yu Yuphoria]2. Power button issue  [Lumia 520]3. Short of internal memory [Android one/ Micromax A1]4. Call receiver speaker non-functioning or with low volume [Karbonn Titanium Dazzle S201, Nokia C3-00]5. Wifi issue/Baseband issues [Samsung Galaxy R]I got faster delivery, Thanks Amazon for your quick service.Phone build quality : Excellent. Craftsmanship!Phone stability : Superb.Baseband ,calling quality : superWifi behavior : ExcellentMIUI : Stock android is always better. UI not so great but still its fine. This is only negative I found so far.Battery life : Waw!Display QUALITY : Superb!Any thing wrong I found : NO!So overall go for it! Its good phone and as I purchased taking all discounts...for me its super value for money!",2,1
B0117H62QK,3,"I reviewed the hardware that was used inside the phone and shortlisted this phone when I wanted to buy an android phone. Did not want to buy Samsung or other phone because of the latency and heating problem, etc. Now I think whatever best hardware you use on Android it still freezes. Which I don't get to experience in Windows Lumia'. Waiting for windows 10 ROM released to Mi4i to use windows.Pros:1. Camera is good. There is good light allowed in the camera. But white balance is not correct. I don't get true color like when I take in Lumia phone.2. Display clarity also very good.3. The internet is good when using 4G. This is the first time I used 4G with Reliance Jio and for my surprise it cloaked maximum 70mbps download speed and 8mbps upload speed. Otherwise average 5mbps download speed.4. Video clarity is good.5. Charging is quick.Cons:1. Audio level is not great.2. Screen is not scratch proof. Within 3 days of use I saw some scratches and had to use tempered glass. Whereas 3 years I have used Lumia phone and did not had any scratches.3. Heating is there when put to charging and while talking on the phone. May be because it is in 4G network.4. Battery drains very quick when too much of 4G internet use.Most other cons are due to software, freezing, network disconnected (no service), camera true color, etc.",2,1
B0117H62QK,5,"Best phone upto 15k range. Worth buy.Camera: Best upto 25k phones, I was not able to differentiate the same picture which was taken from iphone 6 and from mi4i. You can capture & put that photo as your wallpaper. I have uploaded some pictures which was taken by me with the same phone.Battery: This is the only con in mi4i. Its not upto that mark if you will use mobile data continuously. It will work upto 15-18 hours in 2g and 10-12 hours in 3g. But if you use wifi then it will defntly work for one & half day minimum. There is no heating problem at all as people mention that phone heats more..bla..bla.. Its normal heating there, Even iphone also heats upto that limit.Speed: 2gb ram is given but user can utilize only 1gb. So all pre installed app & main function will run on that 1gb Part which is not for user,, its good. In remaining 1gb, all app will run which will be installed by user.Game: I dont know why people play game in mobile phones even after avilability of laptops..computer..xbox etc.. Mobiles are not for playing hames at all.. I never played any game in mobile so i cant tell you the performance about gaming.Look: Perfect, you will love it.. without cover it seems an extraordinary mobile with curvey shape at the coorners, Best look..Overall: Its a worth buy product upto 15k range even the best product in that range. Just go for it..you will love it.",2,1
B0117H62QK,1,"I purchased a Mi4i phone from Amazon approximately one month ago for Rs 9999.Yesterday my phone suffered a slight fall from a height of about 1.5-2 feet. Despite there being a screen protector and flip case, there is a hairline crack on the glass. Even though there is no damage to the LCD, the touch is functioning erratically.I've been informed that the same would not be covered within warranty and I have been quoted a price of Rs 4900+189 for repair of the same.I have three concerns:(i) Why are Xiaomi phones not sturdy enough to sustain a drop from 1.5-2 feet, such incidents are ""normal"", and not ""accidental""/deliberate or extraordinary infliction of damage.(ii) Why is the touch not working? Multiple phones crack/shatter but their screen continues functioning. There is further no corelation between the part cracked and the areas where the touch doesn't function. The same only reflects the poor construction of the phone.(iii) Finally and most importantly, why is the price of repair so ridiculously high? Even Apple charges only Rs 7000 for a Rs 50000+ phone. The market rate for screen replacement is 15-20% of device price. Xiaomi is charging over 50%!Such practices of setting arbitrary and ridiculously high prices for out of warranty service and replacement amount to Unfair Trade Practices as defined under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.Not only do I contend that I am not at fault and that the company should cover my phone under warranty, but even if I have to pay for the same, it should not be more than 15-20% (approximately Rs 2000) of the device value, which is in line with standard industry practice.",2,1

Mi4i is extremely bad product, hangs a lotttt, extremely slow performance, and lot of times both the parties to the call are unable to listen to each other (neither the voice from Mi4i reaches the recipient  nor the voice of other party can be listened.

B0117H62QK,1,"One of the worst phones that I have come across!On paper it may seem value for money and it may have great specs but even with 2 GB of ram it hangs so much that it gets you frustrated.Whats the point of having a smart phone when it hangs and doesnt even let you make a call, or when it doesnt show your contacts.I had been using a windows phone earlier and I realise that I was so much more happier using it.The apps and phone updates daily which will eventually lead to filling up of entire internal storage and since it doesnt even have a memory card slot, you wont be able to do anything. Out of the 16GB it shows only 9-10GB is available for my personal use of which also Apps will take up >2GB.Cons:-1) Heats up2) Battery doesnt even last a day (Barely lasts 6-7 hours) even with normal use3) The sound quality is so so4) The phone hangs a lotWont recommend this phone. Its better to go for a windows phone rather than this. This was by far the worst investment I have made.",4,1
B0117H62QK,5,"Excellent phone. This piece comes with the latest software update which solves the heating issues in older models. That was one apprehension that I had when I was planning to buy this phone. I do not see any heating issues either while charging or while using. Note that I haven't played any cpu heavy games yet. I did not see any lags during usage. Good battery backup (I'm mostly on wifi and still I can go without charging everyday :-)). Clear display. The best thing is it auto adjust when you are in sun or under any other bright light.Very good cameras - front and back. Clear pics. Although the clarity of front one under dim lights is not that good.Only thing which I would miss very soon is secondary storage. I guess I would need to get into the habit of either deleting or occasionally taking backups.Now about the seller, it took a while for the seller to ship the phone. When I contacted Amazon customer care, I got a response that this phone went out of stock. I will have to wait for a couple of more days before it can be shipped. That was bit annoying. But still I got the product on promised time (10 days from the date of payment).",4,1

B0117H62QK,5,"Mi4i - The Market Killer in the below 15000 segment.Okay, I have been using this mighty beast for over a month now.This phone has the best display in its segment, 1080 p at 441 ppi, the videos actually function better than my HP probook which has a 1080 p display at 390+ ppi.its 2 gb ram functions perfectly and I play asphalt 8, sniper 2, nba jam regularly for about an hour or so...don't read reviews about heat generation, post lxi6.5.6.0 update (which u will receive ota as soon as u connect a wifi/3g/4g)- the heating problem has been solved satisfactorily.yea, playing wwe2k15 is troublesome, but it's a laggy game and works a little slow on my Samsung note 4 too..anyhow, comparing mi4i with note 4 would be unfair on the device.the camera has beautify feature pre installed. The polycarbonate sleek slim body is an envy to the users or sony  xperia or Samsung users & even Yu yureka owners. when you hold its 130 g light frame, u feel it's indeed a flagship device.The best part...MIUI 6 app features...u have pre installed themes, app locks to protect gallerry/messages/watsap etc from others..in fact it gives an option to lock any app from the in-menu itself. u needn't worry about ur privacy anymore. there are options like pocket dial lock. hide pictures in gallery, floating lollipop notifications which won't stop a video or game if u receive a call inbetween, shake to align icons n widgets feature, inbuilt notification light color choosing option etc.it's a power packed phone and the 3030/3120 mah battery lasts a day easily with 1 hour of gaming n regular wifi/3g use.the charger is A2 generation fast charge tech adapter and charges the phone in approx. 2.5 hours...please don't use it via usb cable, it will take around 6 hours due to low power output.Cons:like every phone, it has a few cons too..there are no headphones with the handset and it's a big let down considering even micromax spark gets one at 4999/-there is no memory card slot, its biggest let down. but, I bought a transcend 880s flash drive usb 3.0 otg and you can store apps in the pen drive by using lets go app on playstore. it supports microusb 2.0 and otg upto 32 gb, still a bit of a letdown.no video calling feature via sim cards...Skype/watsap/viber etc are functional with an exceptional performance front camera.Conclusion : don't let negative reviews fool u, it's an awesome mid segment device and currently outperforms the other similar products like yu yureka/honor 4x/Lenovo a7000/asus zenphone 2/xperia c3/xperia m4/moto g 2nd generation etc in both display, screen resolution,looks, lollipop interface (some of them are not even lollipop specs) and build quality/performance.go for it..at 13k with the only handset supporting 4g on both sims simultaneously, it's a great steal.",9,1

B0117H62QK,2,My experience with Mi4i.After 1 week of normal usage it has been found that the mobile is not at all good for those who cares for their health.In daily usage with at-most 4 apps the temperature is at 43 deg which is not at all acceptable.When in call for more than 5 mins the phone heats up like you are near a stove and you experience the heat at your head.Pros:1. Build quality(Simple and Classic) 9/102. Camera (Very Good) 9/103. Screen 10/104. Touch sensitivity 9/10Cons:1.Over heating (You can't bear that heat in hands and at head)2.Battery drains quickly even when not in use.3 Poor internet connectivity over mobile data even on 3G4.High SAR value. You can feel when you are talking more than 5 mins.5.You can not get called ID picture while receiving calls.6. Very poor hardware optimization at temperature control on mother board.7.Though it is a 2GB RAM mobile you only get around 800 MB free RAM which is of no use when playing High quality games.8.Speaker volume is very less.9.Hangs when you capture more than 8 photos continuously.10.Need to reboot daily for good amount of RAM which is not possible all the time.I am not a fan to any brand but when you are investing money on anything it should worth of every rupee.,1,1
B0117H62QK,2,"The phone came slowly but it reached on 15th Aug (on national holiday) so its good on amazon part. The phone was okay, usual stuff you can find in other reviews, main thing to return the phone was that it was heating up even on normal tasks (no playing games), I was setting up the new phone as anyone does like adding accounts, installing essential apps, syncing data and it was heating up. Though there was not much heat but I have never used a phone which would heat up even that much while doing these simple tasks, I use iphone 6 now and it even heats less when I play games on it. So i gave it like 6-7 hours but the heat was even there when I was not doing anything, so i decided to return the mobile. Next day I returned the mobile back to amazon.Conclusion: If you are okay with a little bit of heat then its fine.A recommendation to new buyers, recently I searched alot of cpu's being used now a days and I recommend that you go with Snapdragon 8 series processors like 801, 810 etc. not 6 series, this mi4i and yureka etc. are all 6 series snapdragons and though they might claim to be efficient etc. they will lag / choke etc and they are nothing when compared to 8 series processors.",1,1
B0117H62QK,5,"DO TAKE SOFTWARE UPDATE V6.5.5.0 OR ABOVE FOR ELIMINATING HEATING ISSUES1. Heating issue of the processorI have used the device for about a day without updating the software to v6.5.5.0. Observed pretty heavy heating while multitasking.After updating the software, trust me, the heat emitted by the gadget is very less.. While multi tasking with multiple apps opened such as facebook, whatsapp, message etc the heat temperature measured is only 43 which is pretty acceptable, tested the same with a friend in his mi3, even he got the measured temp of above 50 in same conditions... So xiaomi have very well controlled the heat emitted by the hardware sd615, which is well known for emitting large volume of heat.. But do remember, take the latest software update!!!2. Antutu benchmark scored about 39k in performance mode and about 28k in balanced mode... I believe these are pretty good scores in terms of performance...3. Is heavy gaming possible with mi4i? will it emit more heat while heavy gaming?My answer would be mi4i can handle pretty heavy gaming.. Atleast see d antutu scores... I have played asphalt8, one of the most 3d complex game available in the market, for continuously about 20mins, measured temperature of the device after that never exceeded 55..these are pretty acceptable standards for any gadgets, i believe...4. Is lollipop miui6 have any difference than its kitkat version?Absolutly no.. Miui6 skin over kitkat or lollipop looks pretty identical, i cannot spot a single difference between those.. Moreover miui6 over kitkat or lollipiop, it already have 90% features of the lollipop, including on screen notifications...5. For techies around here, as compared to mi3, mi4i only have a single system on which rom is installed, so forget about dual boot here.. Also mi4i initially had user available storage space of about 11gb, which is 1gb less than that of mi3. I could understand this is because of the heavy lollipop",1,1
B0117H62QK,4,"Xiaomi Mi 4i comes with a polycarbonate rear cover which is non removable and this cover wraps the phone from the rear side giving smooth rounded corners and edges. In terms of design there are more hints of the Redmi 2 rather than the Mi 4. Theres a soft touch matte finish with a non grease coating. The volume rocker and the power/standby button on right hand side are made of steel and have a nice feedback. The dual SIM tray is located on left hand side. On the top you have the 3.5mm audio jack and at the base there is the micro USB charging and data transfer port.The Xiaomi Mi 4i houses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 SoC (second generation) which has an octa core processor. You get a quad core Cortex A53 clocked at 1.7GHz also known as the performance cores and another quad core processor clocked at 1.1GHz known as power saving cores. It has an Adreno 405 GPU. This is paired with 2GB LPDDR3 RAM.The Mi 4i runs Android 5.0 Lollipop with the MIUI 6 skin on top. In terms of appearance, there isnt a different look despite the Android Lollipop treatment. Only when you are in the Play Store to download apps, do you notice visually different controls from the MIUI 6 skin.It comes with 16GB of internal storage of which 12.9 GB is available to the user. Sadly, there isnt a provision to add in a microSD card. According to Xiaomis Hugo Barra, the reason behind not having a microSD card slot was to ensure space-saving on the motherboard, since Xiaomi has used a small form factor motherboard to accommodate a large capacity battery (3120mAh). Barra also claimed that if users added in a poor quality microSD card in the slot, that would lead to performance issues. He said that Xiaomi does plan to come out with a higher capacity variant soon, but did not give any fixed timeline. It looks like Xiaomi wants you to use the Mi Cloud storage platform if you have higher storage needs, which may not be to everyones liking.The Xiaomi Mi 4i has a dual SIM, dual standy mode and can take in 4G SIM cards in both the slots. It features 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS/GLONASS and USB OTG.Presence of the second generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 SoC paired with 2GB RAM is enough to handle most tasks. The phone works well in the performance mode and the Adreno 405 GPU is capable of handling heavy games such as Asphalt 8: Airborne and Dead Trigger 2. Browsing on Chrome with over 10 tabs open at a time, along with 10 apps running in the background didnt slow down the device or make it freeze.",1,1
B0117H62QK,1,"Initially after seeing the reviews, I purchased blindly and recommended to my friends and family members. Also almost reviews in the internet was wrong about this product.Four main issues of this product.1. Not Enough RAM: Because most of RAM is used by MiUI6 ROM (almost 1gb), Did not improvement after updating to MiUI7 ROM.2. Heating Issue: While playing Games are watching videos, the mobile get very hot and can't put in ur pocket after playing games are watching videos.3. Battery: battery just runs out in one day.4. Performance: every way performance, opening and closing apps , opening webpage , opening Games  are equivalent to My MotoG 1st gen mobile.I get this mobile for 10K without any cashback offer and sold it in OLX for 8K in 2 weeks... its a loss, but piece of mind... Back with MotoG 1st gen...Even though some Software engineers are working in India for this mobile, its pure China Product. not worth for Indian Buyers",1,1

Then they asked me to download a ROM and reinstall it after creating a backup. Done it and problem not resolved. On the other hand after I installed the new ROM the back up that I created doesn't exist. Thank you so much to Mi for loosing my data.

Never dropped the phone, it was in my pocket and probably got some bit of extra pressure.This is not covered under warranty and now I have got to spend about Rs 4000 to get the touch screen replaced.I had a Samsung Galaxy S2 before and accidentally dropped it several times but the screen never broke. Also, my wife got a crack on her's and was still able to use it. Only with Xiaomi, you cannot use the phone even with a minor crack on screen.Very frustrating.",1,1

B0117H62QK,1,"""Mi4i""....the WORST OF THE WORST Product ever manufactured....Even I was one of xiaomi fan who had an MI3 and powerbank from MI. Inspired by these products I purchased this Mi4i on the flast sale on 28th July 2015, it took 6 days to deliver the product. On 3rd August I received the handset and was curious to enjoy this piece. But my expectations was in vain, as soon as I switched on the phone, severe heating and batter was at 3% which I thought its common in a new smart phone. So I switched off the phone and put for charge for 4 hours and later switched it On, BATTERY HEATING ISSUE was still there and the BATTERY DRAINING was like flowing water within 1hour the battery was at 10%....I contacted the call centre for this issue they said me to do some tests and finally said "" ITS A BATTERY ISSUE AND ITS COMMON IN ALL Mi4i"".This response was said easily by the call centre person.Asked me to go to service centre for a free Battery replacement....Man its a new phone and they are easily asking me to waking to a service centre....Worst and pathetic service and call centre...I have wrote this to all major online Gadgets reviews.And more over they are not in a policy of RETURN ORDER which most of the major ecommerce business has it like Amazon and Flipkart.Please friends never buy this phone, they are cheating people and no service even for day old product....Worst of the worst service Industry, finally they proved that they are from CHINA...",3,1

B0117H62QK,5,Much more better than moto g. Recently I am buyed one moto g. I also used redmi note. Redmi products are user friendly and easy to handle. A really good smart phone. On the other hand buying moto g is wastage of money. It one of the poorest phone I have ever seen. So pls don't go for moto g 3rd gen. Buy redmi always. Ifvi have a option then certainly I am change my moto g 3rd gen with mi 4i.,1,1

B0117H62QK,5,"I am completely in LOVE with this phone. I bought this phone for my birthday. I had selected the Two-Day-Guarantee delivery option and I got it the next day itself.The battery life is amazing. It lasts for about a day and a half which includes usage and standby. Full charging upto 100% takes 2 hours approximately.The camera is lovely. Back camera could have been a little better but still, it is amazing. The front camera on the other hand is beyond outstanding. It is one of the best front cameras I have ever come across.The built is very sleek and attractive. I'd say just perfect, and the colours add to it's awesomeness.Even though it doesn't have an expandable memory option, I would say, no big deal. 16 GB or 32 GB is enough. The necessity however, will vary from person to person but since I don't store anything in my phone except a few photos and apps, the memory size is decent.I wasn't very impressed with the charger that comes with it. It's a two pin charger and started heating up the very first time.Phone performance is just out of the world. Even with a few apps running, the phone runs smoothly.The speaker sound quality is great.Overall, I would say, PLEASE buy this phone because it is 100% value for money and it's a phone that will love you back.CONS: Camera could be a little better.2. The charger isn't very impressive.",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,"I bought this phone around a month back after doing my research for a long time. I had Samsung note 1 previously which I bought  for 35k. In 3 years it became extremely slow even after few formats and a battery change. I was  not able to whole heartedly  buy a new phone because of the huge amount invested in the old phone.  So I decided to buy low  cost phones always because for  10 k you have the liberty of even purchasing a latest phone each year or whenever you feel like upgrading . Finally I decided to buy either MI 5 if it is launched soon or mi4i ( if price drops ) .  Finally, I bought this phone for 8500 ( 9999 mrp - 10 % cash back) 16 GB  versionMi4i did not make me feel like I am using a low cost phone at all. The phone is excellent for this price. I bought this because many people suggested MI is always value  for money.Cam clarity:Cam clarity is good. But my brother using Samsung s5 says his cam is better than this. Photos and videos  on my phone looks great.  Haven't yet checked and compared in laptop with my previous Samsung note  or my brothers Samsung s5. Compared in few of my friends phones in the same price range and this one is better than theirsSpeakers :Average.Processor:Great speed even without using performance modeHeating issues:I am an average user.  Did too much of talking and browsing.  Did not do gaming. Did not face any heating issue. I updated 4g SIM few days back.  Only one time I faced very little bit heat.  it is not unmanageable.  not sure if it is because long browsing over 4g network. Even I am typing this review for more than 30 to 45 minutes in non air-conditioned room over WiFi. Did not face any heating issue.Battery :Great battery backup.  Phone is definitely working for at least 1 day (24 hours)  for average to above average user.  I use 4g while leaving outside home.  After coming home turn off 4g and switch  to WiFi. I always have network on. I don't switch to 2g or 3g for battery saving.Weight:Extremely light weight.  The phone is easily holdable in hand and 5 inch is easy to operate in single handOS :Miui is but different than plain vanilla android but it is good and simple.STORAGE:The only caveat in this phone is no expandable memory. For an average user I think he need to backup once in 2 or 3 months.  I liked 32gb variant.  But only the 16 GB came with the exciting offer.Overall great buy and great product from Mi.",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,"Having been using the Mi4 now for 4+ months - absolutely brilliant phone. 64GB ROM and 3GB memory - the phone is super fast. The display is amazing, especially compared with my previous phone - Galaxy S2. I am not using an additional screen guard but the top plastic cover is amazingly tough and clear. Sound and battery life - meets expectations, although the speaker slot on one side of the phone takes a bit of time to use properly. Using a headset - no problems. And, seems to support all bluetooth devices out of the box.I do not use the Mi account, and ""report home"" is disabled as far as I can make out. But, the updates still work fine - only can not download skins or themes, which is fine with me. Further, the Mi implementation of the Android gives me super control over my apps in terms of what they are doing, including reporting home - something that was missing in my previous phone. And, this by itself is a great feature to have to stop apps from sending data back to their makers.Very, very impressed. Good bye, Samsung.",0,0
B0117H62QK,1,"Very poor  Phone with  Worst possible  and Money Minded Service .I had bought a MI4i and gifted a Redmi 2 to my Father inLaw .Below are the issues1 . The Screen of the phone Cracks without any fall , even if you keep the phone in your jeans also the screen cracks(Mi4i ) .1  .A portion of Screen in Redmi 2 became Unresponsive  .Planning to Throw it Away .2 . Its has one of the worst possible post sales service . I took my Mi4i  phone to the Indiranagar Service Centre for screen repair/replacement  .The Executive called me after 2 days and told they do not have stock of the screen and it will take months for new stock of screen .Already they have a huge queue of people for screen replacement . I went to take back the phone . The Executive says i need to pay the Service change . I asked for what .She told once i leave the phone at the Center i need to pay the Service Change of 115 rs .Such a Money Minded Company . I asked the Executive for a Written letter for the Same , She Plainly Refused give anything in Writing .....3 . The phone Gets Hanged 3-4 times a day and Reboots automatically .4. the phone gets heated up like anything .If you want to buy a Xiaomi phone , please visit any Xiaomi Service Centre and Get feedback from the people there .Its has been a Pathetic Experience...",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,"The Mi4i is a phone I have come to fall in love with. It is sleek, it is stylish, and it delivers high performance, not to mention the absolutely excellent camera.Pros:Amazing camera automatically beautifies pictures and makes those selfies truly worth postingGood battery life. Lasts a whole day with plenty of music and calls.The 2 GB RAM really boosts performance and it is easy to run apps.Lots of capacity to store photos, videos, music, apps and movies. Considering a BluRay movie is 1.2 GB usually, 16 GB is more than enough for the average user.Lots of cute themes and a nice music player.Excellent service by Gadgetwood for the repair of the phone which includes pick and drop facility.I also bought Lenovo Vibe S1 which seemed to be at par with Mi4i, but MI has a much smoother functioning and more user-friendly layout, smarter camera and better battery.Cons:The music volume is a little low.The case that I bought from the MI Store wasn't good, and not many accessories seem to be available in the market for this phone.But that's it!!! It's little cost to pay for the services that this phone gives.",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,"After a Few months i was very confused what would me buy a better smartfone. I daily check out on many sites which phone is better.i discuused to the experts any many people  which phone are better.they told them mi4i is much more better phone then other compatble feautres like as Moto g 3rd,lenovo A700,lenovo K3 note and some others.but i did;nt belve on this tym.but i used a moto g 3rd gen i opend a lock screen i swipe a 5 or 6 times to unlock a screen but they didi not response nt some kind of lack ness in this .so i confirmed moto g 3rd is good phone some but times they did not response imedeatly and second is lenovo A700 My friend its have a lenovo a700 but he used a few monthes and they gave a such as bitch problem. the touch of lenove is wroking stop .Its true You belive me.i sad this wrost phone so my friend take a decison to bought a mi4i .and third one is lenovo 73 note .its good phone but they screen is not a look better . the back panel of lenovo k3 note is sme qulaity issue  they7 disi not propley fiit to the phones. i used a phone one day they i holded the phone i feels the back pannel not fitt propely.so afte a long time i decided to bought a mi4i .its awsome phone ever and ever its qulaty is tooo excelent they have no heating issue some people post a comment to heat problem they ol sucks its fake/overol am fuul satisfy to the mi4i . i will be used a phone a months and i upadate a reviews to how its works them .but am satisfy .any other user to confuse to ehich phone a buy go for it mi4i . so user wait my next update a reviws as soon . thnks to amazon. to  provied a betther smart phone to the today genration . i will be wait a MIUI 7 upadte on mi4i launch in 19 agust in india .",0,0
B0117H62QK,4,"Its definitely a good phone for its price. I bought this because of reviews from my friends who have bought the same and also the next day delivery option promptly given by Amazon.I am experiencing a major issue with the phone. My mobile data keeps fluctuating and many a times, I have lost important updates such as emails and chats on whatsapp. This happens only when the phone works on mobile data: 3G/4G and works absolutely fine when connected on WIFI. The funny part is that I am using Airtel on my phone and I also have an Airtel 3G wifi dongle. Both of them are accessed from the same location but mobile data keeps stopping every time whereas when I connect to wifi, it works perfectly well.Updating an app or just a google voice command doesn't open because of this issue. I don't feel this is a software glitch!Pros:Lightweight, slim, Decent Looking, Decent Features.Cons:NO EXPANDABLE MEMORY AVAILABLE!UI is a bit confusing especially when you get into the menu/settings.Sync feature drains off the battery pretty fast.No headphones with this phone.If you are planning to purchase, pay the extra 3000 and go for the 32gb model as 16gb gets over pretty quickly.",0,0

B0117H62QK,5,"I always restrained myself from buying Xiaomi phones, primarily because of it being a Chinese company and secondly as it has a heavily customized UI. I have always been a lover of stock android, but honestly I have to admit, though it's similarity with IOS but the UI is just awesome with minimal or no lag. A very light and slim phone. Sharp and crisp display. I think for a 5 inch phone 1080p resolution is good enough. I have seen QHD display on Samsung S6 at a local retailer, but honestly on a 5 inch screen you won't find much of a difference. Display is on par with the AMOLED that you find on Samsung S4. A fully pumped up battery will complete a full day's tour with enough juice left at bed time and that's the report after keeping 3G on all day long. Call quality is good. The sound from the speaker on the phone is the only let down that I found so far. It's not that bad but lacks loudness and a stereo would had been better. Camera quality is just good with no complaints there. I would strongly recommend this phone. A complete value for money. I don't play games much so no comments for that.I think Mi 4 should take care of that with an SP 801 processor and 3 gigs of RAM. I was confused over the two but went with Mi 4i for it's better display quality and overall value for money. Also it's 64 bit architecutre, end user however will not see a difference as the mobile platform has not moved to 64 bit yet. As we still have majority of the application on 32 bit.Build Quality: 10/10Display: 10/10 (my personal preference as I don't find any reason to have a QHD display on a phone except if you want the battery to drain faster)Call Quality: 9/10Speaker Sound: 7/10Battery: 9/10Cellular Connectivity: 9/10UI; 10/10",0,0

B0117H62QK,4,"I have got this mobile for about 3 months from now. I have been longing to write the reviews for Mi4i. I have sub categorized some features so that I hope it might be usefulPerformance - With 2GB RAM working is seamless. No lags. (3.5 of 5)Display - Rich and vibrant display. So its clean and also in HD (3.5 of 5)Weight - The most feather weighted phone I have ever seen. Handy too. (4 of 5)Battery - A 3125 mAh is enough for to hold the battery for a single day(postday charge upto 100%) while using Data(What's App,Facebook.etc..) (3.75 of 5)Camera - The 13 MP Sony/Samsung Lens is a signature to this product. Also it is preinstalled with Beautify 2.0 which is amazing. ( 4 of 5)Flash - A Dual tone flash which gives low lighting a woow into effect.(3.8 of 5)Front Camera - A responsive 5 MP front camera useful for skype and selfies.(3.5 of 5)I hope by this point of time all would have found more and more about the Mi4i heat problem. YES initially it was present. But an update was released to overcome this problem and BELIEVE ME OR NOT the heating is reduced enormously.By the use of PERFORMANCE MODE higher end games such as Modern Combat 3 and others do work good. Well it does consume power and of course heat is generated.I have tested it personally that the heating is not more than 44 degrees and that is by running the mob in PERFORMANCE MODE.A Qual - Comm SnapDragon 615 processor with an Octa core processor is mind blowing. Initially, if the phone is not in PERFORMANCE the the usage of the Quad core. IF turned on, then it is the Octa Core at work.DRAWBACKS WHAT I FEEL AS A EASTER EGG:1) There is no EXTERNAL MEMORY SPACE.Only the in build memory is available were of 16GB only 12GB is available.2) No GORILLA GLASS. I suggest you to but the phone with the TEMPERED GLASS of Xiaomi itself.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All basic apps and functionalities are in-built and the best is given for a novice user or a new user to droid. Experience the LOLLIPOP version is great and makes it more interactive and impressive.The whole rating for Xiaomi Mi4i as a current user is (3.85 of 5)Recommend you to but it.If u still have queries or any information you need do ask me.",0,0
B0117H62QK,2,"Cons:.4G/3G does not work while on call. So can't do whatsapp or check mails when on a call.Very bad heating problem, especially when on long calls or when playing games.Drains battery very quickly when gaming mode.The gallery is very bad, you cannot have pic folders for say particular events (say B'day bash) unless you dont have an Mi account and it is synced continiously to cloud.Can't change system fonts in MIUI 7/8. So I am can't beautifully stylize my phone anymore.Very bad camera in low light.I bought 16GB and it's really too low cause 5 GB is used by system and I am effectively left with 11GB which is nothing, should have gone with 32GB. Lesson learnt.Some apps like Quora are very unresponsive but works very well on my old Samsung Note2..There is some pesky issue, when you cover the Top of the Screen where the ear-speaker is place. I think all the censors are placed there. If that region is covered then, the phone does not work properly and gives an error to press volume and back button simultaneously to stop that from happening. Which is very annoying!!Overall a very average phone worth 20% more than it's true value. Not for pro on the move looking for sleek-stylish design and performance.",0,0
B0117H62QK,4,"Phone has a splendid design. The display clarity is so beautiful that I dont feel like putting down my phone. I have seen/had 1080p display phones earlier and no phone has such a clarity as this one has. Battery backup is decent enough. On an average use it could last for more than a day. It might be a slight disappointment for gamers which this phone would fail to cater their needs to. I haven't felt heating issues while playing games as was complained against earlier. However it does get tad little hot but only after some continuous playtime. Also playing high end graphics games is not a forte for this phone. Games like Nova 3 literally lags and lags even in performance mode. I am not much into games so this wouldn't bother me much. Another slight let down is that me coming from Nexus background I am so much used to lolipop style background apps which MIUI doesnt have that and the one which it has is not at all good. It takes a while to get used to MIUI but it doesnt come any close to stock android experience per say. BTW the phone size 5"" inch display I guess is perfect. I was initially wishing this phone came with 5.5"" display but trust me, this size is just right about in your hands. Go for this phone if you are looking for some splendid display, good design, decent batter backup and budget minded.",0,0
B0117H62QK,4,"Alright people I don't usually write reviews but I feel like I should spill the beans on this very product. So.. First of all Amazon's delivery services were wonderful and yes they did corporate very well. Now coming in to the product.Pros: 1)The FHD screen is really gratifying.2)The camera is of top notch quality. The front as well as the back camera capture some sharp and amazing images which at this perticular price point is just astounding!! However the low light images were a but noisy.. But the images captured in proper light condition (inside a room or sunlight) were spectacular!!3)The battery life is again as great as the great wall. It will easily last you a day or even more ( taking of moderate to high users)4) The build quality is pretty solid. The mobile looks as premium as any 96k expensive stuff. The phone is really slim and sturdy. ( Though a bit slippery )5) the phone runs on android lollipop and the MIUI 7 is highly customisable and user friendly.6) The touch is really responsive and the volume rockers and the power button are well crafted.7) The octa-core processor easily juggles most of the applications with ease. As smooth as butter.Con's : 1)The speakers aren't as loud as I expected them to be. But they are loud enough to enjoy depressing songs on a terrible heartbreaking days.  (LOL) The bass comes out to be pretty good. Though the sound delivery via earphones is amazing.. But I wish the loudspeaker was a little more louder.2) Some applications (very rarely though) but crashes. Google play services and all..3) The phone tends to heat up like a toaster while paying heavy games like (dead trigger 2 and asphalt 8) after 10 mins or so, though the heating is tolerable but I never expected this heating issue.4) The phone doesn't support a memory card.. That's just like owning a kingdom without the king. But I guess 16 gigs of storage should be sufficient for most of the users.5) No removable battery.. That simply means no hard reset right? WRONG!! You can perform the hard reset by long posting the power button for around 5-7 seconds. That's definitely not a deal breaker.Conclusion: As far as quality delivery is concerned.. This one is (undoubtedly) ""The One ""!! This is apparently the best option under the 13k range. I'm really happy with my decision. And for those who like to judge the book by its cover, people Xiaomi is turning out to be a premium brand. So to all the haters out there stop criticising without any reason B| . Enjoy the joyous ride.. (Only if you are purchasing) ;)",0,0

B0117H62QK,5,"Earlier i was thinking whether i should go for this or not, as many of my friends were saying it is China, heating problem and all. They were suggesting me for Yureka plus, because my budget was 10-12K. I saw review in you tube about it and i thought lets go ahead and buy it.Finally i got this mobile by Amazon within 3 days. I wont go for specification,as all know about it. Whatever i found in this is, it looks simply awesome, slim. I have bought white colour, as per my opinion you should buy white colour because its back is mat finish white. here will be no stain on your mobile back side. Battery backup is really good. On full charging if you are using net, game or video  for one day it is enough, you need not to worry at all. For normal usage 2 days enough.Camera is superb both front and rear, kind of digital camera. Except this no lagging, no heating everything is fine. At last I am using this mobile since last 40 days, I didn't find any issue.",0,0

B0117H62QK,5,"Using this amazing phone since 1 month n below r my views- Stunning design.. Probably best in this price range-1080 p full HD display with 441 ppi makes the screen jaw dropping experience-  snapdragon 615 processor with 2 GB of RAMGives a seamless n lag free multitasking performance- Touch screen in very responsive giving n overall exciting experience- camera is the best I have seen so far on any phone in this price range. U can't stop urself clicking selfies with this phone.- Mi UI is the best of all the UI's u can get on any smartphone with loads of themes n customisation options-  Battery life is g8. Lasts a day even wen browsing n listening music for more than 2 hours- Just takes 45 minutes to charge up, which to me is simply amazing- The only disappointing thing is the 12.7 GB available memory n no Sd card slot- This is by far the best smartphone I have ever used-This phone Just made me completely forget my amazing experience with HTC..",2,1

Trust me, i didn't call either opened any default app, even then its Heating very abnormally.Look is really good. Esp Grey color piece is awesome, however bottom line is not worthy.Guys i would say and tell to all in this forum, Decided and take a call on purchase. Hope my piece would have such issue either it should be for all.However i am not luck to own MI 4I, lets c if any luck work out in future with MI product of MI 4C.",0,0

Low volume of ringtone, Vibration quality is also poor. you won't be able to sense the phone is ringing if you are at noisy area.3. Auto key operation even in lock screen. Many times the phone started music and other operations while kept in pocket. tried every options still the problem exists.4.Scratch resistance is very poor, i recommend you to buy a screen guard along with this phone.Still i recommend this phone.

B0117H62QK,2,"At first phone seem good to me but after normal usage of five to ten minutes phone gets heated up and it's battery isn't much efficient to go a full day without charge on normal usage. Photo gets heated up quickly and goes above 40+ which can damage the motherboard or any other parts of phone. Even while placed for charging phone remains hot.Now looking on better side of phone, front camera is fabulous. Video clarity and high end game like GTA 3 is supported but phone get heated up very fast so you will not be able to enjoy it. While in call it feels like you can make toast on your phone.",2,1

B0117H62QK,4,"Good phone, probably the best with respect to value for money. THere are a lot of features that you find out only when you search online as the phone does not come with a user manual.However, does heat up quite a bit - makes talking very difficult if u have been on the internet recentlyOut of 2 GB RAM, at any point you only get max. ~900 MB (even in a brand new phone) - the OS takes almost 1GB of RAM. It seems to be running some processes in the background which apparently Xiaomi has refused to disclose. Also if you are not careful all data would automatically get uploaded to Xiaomi's cloud somewhere in China.",0,0

It is very unfortunate that this level defect pieces are dispatched.How to open inbuilt ""Hardware test"" tool:From Home Screen,1. Press Phone button.2. Using Dial keypad, type *#*#6484#*#*3.

B0117H62QK,4,"The first unit I received had a software problem which could not be sorted out and so I returned it. I lost a shatter-proof screen guard which I had already fixed in the meantime. Amazon was very prompt in sending a replacement at my request. The new phone seems to be working fine as far as I can tell. I don't fiddle with my phones all the time like many people do - when I have time on my hands I prefer to read a book! I hope this unit works well. The phone looks elegant, is easy to handle and fits well in a standard shirt pocket too. The first MI update took over seven hours to download and install itself on the phone.",0,0

Great visibility under direct sunlight.Antutu score of 40,000 + beats most of the mid range mobiles of Samsung & Sony.No heating issue encountered yet.Nice camera, with good interface.Only shortcoming is user available disk space of 10.5 GB but it should not be a deal breaker.",0,0

Because Amazon rejected the replacement after 10 days. And after that You will not get solution from Service center also.Even Service center people make your phone condition more bad then earlier condition.This Phone has Heating Issue even after upgradation.So suggest to purchase Other's company mobile by increasing your budget.

B0117H62QK,3,I have been using MI4I since last 20 days. Delivery of amazon was poor.

But believe the 32 GB capacity is not optimized well.phone lags a lot.it appears as if a huge memory card has been inserted in a low RAM phone.So if you are, like me, just by spending 2000 extra you get GB extra so you are wrong the 32 GB is lagging like hell",0,0
B0117H62QK,4,"Very Good phone. Camera quality in HD mode is awesome. Battery life so far is good but should remain the same after a year. Phone has good sharpness on applications as well. the manufacturer has not provided the earphones with the kit, thats something very unusual. Phone gets heated up if Net is kept on for a while. if charging and net are both on, then its gets really heated up. put a good flip cover to minimise the heating effect. but still a Good phone, worth the price. Non - Extension of memory is another set back i should say.",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,I have brought this product for my mom who is new player with android devices. So apparently low usage with multitasking. Installed regular apps like WhatsApp  facebook etc. Performance is well beyond my expectations. No issue of hanging or device warming from last 4 months. Battery last for complete one day with frequent whatsapp usage. I would say it's best for senior citizen with this low budget. I am happy with camera and graphics performance as well.So do not hesitate to buy it with this budget category.,0,0
B0117H62QK,5,"Phone look elegant and UI seems to be great , though there are many reviews says the UI not great.* Expected more local space , I see almost 6 GB Occupied and leaving only 10 GB for the users* Unable to detach the battery (Its not a major concern though)* Could have been a better metallic shining finish* This phone comes without ear phone and you have to buy separate* No external memory card insert (should have considered the 2nd SIM card to act as MicroSD Storage as Optional)",0,0
B0117H62QK,3,"The phone is just satisfactory.Pros(Many)Heating issues.Software runs on its own. Even if you are not clicking anything then also it is running on its own.Major issue: Replacement Policy, only 10 days, while you can get the same price on FLIPKART and also with a 30 day REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE. in the first 10 days the phone usually doesn't show any demerits but you get to see these only after using the phone for a while.Cons(ONLY ONE)I did get the product by the delivery date.",0,0

B0117H62QK,5,I have just used for 3 days..My experience is quite good.. I have updated the software to latest version..- no heating issue- no sound/volume  problem- camera is good- after update only 9GB available for user- it only support micro sim so get you sim replaced to micro one if planning to buy this (some old sim like Airtel magic etc cannot be cut to make it micro sim)Another thing about Amazon. if you order it with normal delivery then it takes 5-7 days for delivery.,0,0
B0117H62QK,1,"Does NOT meet our expectations. The company should mention the actual space available for the customer instead of the total memory space. Although it is mentioned in the full specification yet Mi 4i (16 GB) should have been mentioned as Mi 4i (10 GB). This would give a clear picture. Not fully 5"" as mentioned. Software doesn't read the musics saved under the head ringtones in the phone.Would prefer not to buy and suggest the same. May be it is I Phone of China........But This is India",0,0

Light and sleek!The battery back up is good, goes on easily for a whole day! i have not faced the heating problem with this handset as of now.Screen clarity and resolution is extremely good. Sound quality is amazing.It works with DUAL SIM perfectly. Its absolutely value for money phone.Only problem I am facing is the radio - it suddenly goes off!",0,0
B0117H62QK,5,The phone is simply awesome and I bought it with a 2K discount so that sweetens the deal further. At that price point this was probably the best phone to buy.I upgraded to MIUI 7 soon after the purchase so there aren't any heating issues either. At the moment I do not use the phone for gaming so wont be able to comment on its performance under extreme usage but the phone sure seems capable of doing a lot more than what it is being used for at the moment.,0,0
B0117H62QK,5,"It's definitely the best in its segment. It just the perfect size, not to small for your hand, not too big for your pocket. It features a good camera with a great sensor, not to mention a fast processor. It's super fast, compact and looks stunning as well. Earphones are not included in the packaging. Its just great as a whole package, a good smartphone at a very reasonable rate. If you want a bigger size for a little more, you can go for the Mi 4.",0,0
B0117H62QK,1,"Very poor performance as expected from Chinese brand Xiaomi. No earphone volume while making a call and the other person is not able to hear the person speaking through this mobile. Also, the volume of this phone is too low to hear and hence you may miss many calls when outdoors or in public areas. If spending 13K is an option, better to go with Samsung J5 or rather J7. Best phone in this price range and much better user friendly experience.",0,0

B0117H62QK,1,I must say  this a great phone but it's been only 10 months and the phone's  battery is popping out of the back causing phone screen damage. The phones battery is swelled and it hardly run's less than 2 hours. I ordered many phones from other website but didn't found any defect. It is the only phone mi4i I ordered from Amazon which is defective. Amazon has worst product quality. In the end please don't buy any phone from Amazon.  Peace.,0,0

B0117H62QK,5,Excellent phone.. It uplift my image when carrying very slim and user friendly... Only thing is of we use multiple app it gets heats up but that won't be an issue if I buy a flip cover..

B0117H62QK,5,One year + one month and counting.  I haven't had the chance to visit the service centers regarding any major issues.I falshed my rom once and frequent reboots also started to pop up.  So my advice is to use it as it is.The phone had also survived many majors drops too. Thanks to the glass screen gaurd for that.The only drawback i had faced is the storage issue..,0,0

B0117H62QK,2,"initially i thought it would be a great mobile in terms of function and smoothness but within one year, i am facing loads of problem. Many a times phone gets hanged, gets heated up if you are using internet for an hour, heats up while charging and to my great disappointment, you wont get charger online again if you lost once.just feeling sorry to spend 15k on this s***ty box.",0,0

B0117H62QK,1,Horrible after sales service for all MI phones. My phone has been lying in MI service centre for more than 20 days and officials over there says that they dont have mobile parts to repair. I suggest everyone should think twice before buying these cheap chinese mobile phones. Better spend some money and go for those mobiles which has good services.,0,0
B0117H62QK,5,Love this phone.ProsCamera is excellent. But degrades with duration. Camera maintenance would helpLight weight And comfortable sizeSound quality is pleasant but it is not the best available in the marketConsHeating issueSometimes it gets hanged. I am not sure if that is due to overloading apps,0,0
B0117H62QK,2,"Looks great. Very good product. But I am removing three stars for very poor customer support in India. Screen glass is very delicate, several complaints regarding screen cracking on a normal fall. Worst part is Mi4i exclusive showroom at a chembur, Mumbai did not have screen. It took three weeks for the repair of my phone at a cost of Rs/- 4200.",0,0

B0117H62QK,4,I am a light user but happy with the phone so far. Some app does connect automatically to wifi and turns on sync but I think this is fairly common with the apps these days and is an app issue. I just turn those off as I notice. There was a problem downloading apps over mobile data but that was solved after I did the OS upgrade.,0,0
B0117H62QK,5,Excellent . No problems at all. Touch screen is good all kinds of videos play. Google play store has everything. I don't play games. I was scared about heating problem. But it seems to be solved. No heating issue. I did get this mobile for Rs.9000 on feb 2016 in a limited period offer. Rate it five stars for the money i spend.,0,0
B0117H62QK,1,Delivery was quick but having issue with phone operation as task button gets activated automatically when I am using any other application and gets pressed 6 to 7 times by its own. The issue started in just 4 days of purchase.Really not satisfied with the product delivered. Please resolve the issue on top priority.,0,0

B0117H62QK,4,"There are lots of pros with this phone.I will give few cons only:1. Mild Heating issue on the top section of the phone; mostly while playing games2. Battery backup is 1 day only, dispite of having large battery3. Camera Flash is not great. Pictures taken with flash will be blurred or not clear",0,0
B0117H62QK,1,"Please do not buy it.Today I have got the phone and it has much older version, Play store is not available. It is showing 700+ MB Memory than 16 GB.

B0117H62QK,1,"Don't buy mi products service is pathetic , my mobile stopped working after 2 months and service centres told me that motherboard is faulty and need to replace it and will take 2 months to repair when called to their customer care they are rude and pathetic .My humble request to you all stop buying mi phones",0,0
B0117H62QK,1,The phone overheats a lot even if you unlock the screen and use it to check your messages. Gave 1 star because of its display and camera. What's the use if phone has all the features and feels uncomfortable to hold and use coz of heating issue.. Even after the update the phone heats  Plz don't buy it ull regret,0,0
B0117H62QK,3,I hv booked & purchased today one mobile mi 4i 16gb white color at 9999/-But I hv not done thru the Amazon app. Payment mode was thru hdfc netbanking.

B0117H62QK,1,Terrible phone. Its been less than 3 months since I bought this phone and I am already forced to look for another one. The phone hangs randomly at any time and keeps rebooting by itself.

B0117H62QK,1,Plz dont buy this phone. Its extremely slow and hangs at abt evrythg u do. I ve updated it n done evrythg to boost it bt stilno use.

B0117H62QK,2,"First of all, don't just choose a phone by going through the specs they offer. This phone has a Snapdragon 615 chipset, yes the one which has heating issues in many phones, and guess what, this phone has beaten all of them in the heating competition, Boom! The temperature may go upto 55 degree Centigrades while playing some games, which is uncomfortably hot to handle. Moreover  even after browsing for about 15 mins, the phone starts heating.While playing games, the phone even lags sometimes, which was not expected from a phone with such specs. It has 2 gb ram, out of which you get less than 500 mb to use. The rest is all eaten by the heavy MIUI.The only things that I like about this phone are the camera and it's full HD display.Pros:1. Full HD screen2. Camera (Both 13 MP and 5 MP)3. Light weight/ Slim/ Good looksCons:1. UI lags many times2. Heating issues3. Some applications crash sometimes4. Low volumeInstead, I would suggest you all to go with Moto G 3rd Gen. Although you get to see some low specs on paper, but believe me, Motorola is a great brand and it has optimized everything to make such a device which performs way better than this chinese product. It's lag free and has no heating issue at all. And at the same price tag, you even get expandable memory and water proof features which are something to be considered.",2,1

You must add back cover to have proper grip. Even though its 5 inch, but quite handy like 4.7 inch,5) 2 star for heavy use. Not good for heavy game/app users6) *** Overall am satisfied with phone, due its look, slimness, and screen quality.7) Also do buys its extra head phone (Rs 999), it has a very good bass effect.",0,0

B0117H62QK,1,"All that Glitters is not Gold. The same is true for Mi4i as well. Mi4i become hot when used for gaming. The speakers volume is very less if you want to enjoy music from the device without any ear phones. It hangs as well. The touch is not so good. Overall this seems the worse phone from Mi. So if you want to buy it think 10 times, it would be better if you could go with Moto g or any other phone which is cheaper and better in performance.",0,0
