Give me a break!Name your leads and share your location,I can write your next story to Bhagats perfection.Simple English is my style,Says Chetan Bhagat all the time.I am happy with that, totally fine.But excuse me mister, where is the storyline?Your sexist one-liners are witty no more,Dont you remember, youve told them before?You claim that your writing is for the rich to the slums,They have better IQs than that, dont underestimate them.You are an author who could have been!Youve let it go for the silver screen.Are you trying to increase you reader hood?Or simply selling out to Bollywood?There have been authors just like you,Whove written good books and screenplays too.But youve got too carried away and lost the act,And quoting your Alma matter to hide that fact.Chetan O Chetan, Where are you?I am not an elitist, I used to really like you.Give us simple but also different and new.Slow your star-chase and get real dude!",1532,1
8129135728,1,"[...]The story starts with Chetan and another person(the hero, probably played by Arjun Kapoor/Ranveer Singh in the future) and goes to a flashback as in most of his books. The hero, Mr. Madhav Jha, is a Bihari who is a state level basketball player, not to mention a Prince in his little village. He gets admitted to a famous high-class English medium college in Delhi where he meets the heroine, Ms. Riya Somani (probably Deepika Padukone/ Anushka Sharma) who is tall, fair and also a basketball player with great eyebrows! The hero's antennae pick up the heroine's great legs in her shorts and the love story begins. What is it with Chetan Bhagat and girls wearing shorts? I just don't get it.. Anyway, this heroine is not falling for college love and she agrees to be his ""Half-girlfriend"". Madhav has no other go but to accept it. They go out together, play basketball, she hosts her birthday party and they do other boring stuffs. He doesn't give up trying to get words out of her mouth. This goes on for a while, long enough to bore the readers, and then one day, oops! Madhav makes a mistake and Riya doesn't talk to him anymore. Same campus, not talking, showing faces, ignoring when the other person walks by, not wishing for birthdays... So childish. Kids in 3rd grade behave more matured than this!On college day, Riya and Madhav make small talk again and Madhav tries to apologize. Riya is so generous out of the blue and says everything is fine and that she has to give him something. Now any dumbo would have taken the clue that she was going to give her wedding invitation to him. But our hero is not that sharp you see. He gets shocked, disappointed, heartbroken, lonely and miserable while Riya is off to London.Next comes part II- In his village (yeah that was just the first part of the story). Here is where he actually emerges as a hero. He is crowned the Prince of Dumraon. He helps his mom run a school for the under privileged children. But they need funds to improve the infrastructure of the school. I know this part should move me but Chetan's way of mixing politics with his usual love story is not so successful. Not that I do not appreciate people digging into the darkness of India and trying to uplift the country by creating awareness but I feel Chetan Bhagat is overrated when it comes to motivating the youth. Because clearly he is doing it the wrong way. Dominating love story with a glimpse of a poor Bihar? We all know what the youth would concentrate on. And even if they do want to be motivated, the passion to take an initiative stays only for so long as the commercial mix up masala. This part was more of a complaint journal than an inspiring novel. I did not even enjoy his subtle sarcasm as there was hardly any. Chetan is losing it.Madhav is informed by his local MLA that Bill Gates is visiting the village. Madhav decides to ask for funding for his school from Gates foundation. But he is supposed to make a convincing speech in English, his biggest fear and enemy. This is when Riya makes her entry again! They meet ""accidentally"", become friends again and she helps him with his English classes. And oh with a kiss too! She goes to his house to visit the school and to have his mother's famous litti-choka. The mother character is typical of Chetan. She is charming and caring until the guy brings the girl home. The minute the girl sets foot in her house, the mother character starts PMSing. After the speech for Mr. Bill Gates, Riya vanishes with a note saying she is suffering from cancer (apparently there is no other fatal incurable disease for heroes and heroines). Madhav is heartbroken again. He gets her journal from her landlord and gives it to Chetan Bhagat (I have no idea why). Chetan reveals the fact that she is still alive and it is the noble strategy of Madhav's mother to send Riya away for good.Part III- With just a hunch that Riya might be in New York, he goes all the way across the globe to find her. Only after reaching there he realizes that people don't call it The Big apple for no reason. Dumb but apparently a very romantic move. After searching for two months and two weeks he gives up because he has only two more weeks in New York and he decides to go sight seeing. But that's not the reason. The hero has to give up, especially in the last few days, only then when the mission actually succeeds it will seem triumphant and lets admit it, its a happy moment for all of us. So yeah, he stumbles upon a local singer who gives information that ""Ray"" is singing in a local bar. And get this, he literally runs to the local bar from his place and finds his Riya with beautiful eyebrows again. Now that's her third entry in one bloody book! Ugh! They kiss and hug and all is well in the world again. The Prince and the Princess get back to Dumraon, Mother-Villain turns soft on getting a grandson (she has to otherwise the story won't end), the school is flourishing, Madhav and Riya visit the Big Apple for three months a year (Only limited period offer allotted for Heroine's dreams because they are not so important except for their shorts). Grandson plays basketball and Chetan inaugurates the school function. Happy ending!P.S: Bought this from Flipkart. Loved the bookmark that it came with.",4,1

8129135728,1,"I couldn't understand, how such a lame book got overall 4 star rating. This book is much worst than his last one Revolution 20-20. After reading that one I though this was Chetan's worst one. But Chetan Bhagath made me wrong with this one. From start to end I have never felt like I was reading a novel, instead I was reading the screenplay of a traditional Bollywood masala movie. A very humble request to Chetan, please don't write novels for some producers/directors in Bollywood and spend some time to think about common readers like us.",3,1
8129135728,5,"chetan bhaghat, novels are easy to understand, because he wrote it in simple english.",5,1
8129135728,4,"05-Nov-14: Just finished reading ""Half Girlfriend"" by Chetan Bhagat. A phenomenal and spell-binding narrative that doesn't let you put the book down, especially as you approach the last part of the book. A beautiful love story that will touch your heart and inspire you to chase your dreams. Kudos Chetan, for having written a series of blockbuster novels.",2,1
8129135728,1,"Seriously ??? What was that ??? So disappointing..  Half girlfriend will leave you with full madness.. Anyways.. what else can u expect.. after few pages I just kept passing by until it said  "" the end "" which is the best part of the book :)  . SAD !!!",69,1
8129135728,5,Typical Chetan Bhagat literature!! Bet you wouldn't even do anything else until you finish it!!,3,1
8129135728,2,I have seen many of writing that it is  not a book for the youth.Many of them were not satisfied with this book nor they liked it.Disappointment from Chetan Bhagat,7,1
8129135728,5,"I got it on 10th October, four days before the estimated delivery. I was too happy, But I was more than happy when I started reading it. I made it in one shot. I think most of you usually place your self in the shoes of the characters. You Dream the same as the characters do. Yes, I too do that. But this time I couldn't put myself in the shoes of Madhav, neither Rohan. How can I imagine myself as Madhav who born to a Royal family in Bihar. He was so called prince in the village but not outside it. He is now a common man living with his mother in their very old Haveli. He played basket ball for the state team and now got admission in St. Stephen's college in Delhi through the sports quota. He finds his love in the basket ball court,........and story moves on. Rohan, a boy from Punjab lives in London like Royal with his million dollars property. he can come to St Stephen's college to take Riya(female character of the story loved by both Madhav and Rohan, PLEASE DO NOT RELATE IT WITH 'REVOLUTION 2020' both the stories got unmatchable emotions YOU SHOULD READ IT.) out for a long drive in his Bantley....... So story goes on and at the end Riya finds her real love. If you want to know who the person is Madhav or Rohan? Then read the book. I am sure you'll love it.",5,1
8129135728,1,"Disappointing 'pedestrian prose'! But for the parts that spoke about Stephens which is my almamater (fantastic research on that I have to say!), this book is like the script of a predictable Bollywood flick.",2,1
8129135728,1,"One word- AWFUL!!! Chetan Bhagat needs to understand, if we are purchasing a book and taking our time in reading it, we would need good content to keep us going. The book started off fine but by the time you reach the middle, you'd be trying really hard to read all the lines. I really had to convince myself,""it will get interesting by the next page! It lacks pace and a good story line!Its hard to believe this guy wrote ""Five point someone"" !!!",56,1
8129135728,2,"There are so many 5 and 4 star reviews for this book. But, I did not find it that interesting. The engrossment quotient is fine in the first half, but the second half gets really boring and obvious. The chapter that leads to the climax is unexpected and interesting, however, once you are done with that chapter, you almost know what you will find in rest of the 6 to 8 chapters. This makes it even more boring in the end.Cons:1. Its boring in quite a lot of places, except the first few ones.2. Its not a page turner by any means.Pros:1. If you are trying to learn English and need a beginner novel that lets you practice reading, then go for this book. Actually, I would recommend 5 point someone or 2 states as they are more interesting.If you are well read person or used to reading good writers, you will not like this book.",78,1
8129135728,2,We are paying to get something new from reputed authors like bhagat.But it totally dissapoints with its storyline.Still it may be readable for teenagers.bhagat should start to write story for non-realistic bollywood films instead this.Even this book is not comparative with five point or two states.,6,1
8129135728,1,Not worth even wasting money on this book.Hope some day  chetan bhagat matures from writing silly college love stories to really writing proper friction/non friction books.,2,1
8129135728,1,"Bakwaas story. Chetan is assumed as changing young face of India. One thing I would like to make him aware that our Young India has so high potential, please try to portray it to show as they can really do some thing class apart but not just thinking about a girl and trying to get her. The incident where Madhav put his sources used for flying US was rubbish. People across the world put their whole life to get such opportunities, spend years to avail the chance to become something in life, but the moto shown in this book was stupid. Chetan young minds, teenage and aspirations are not used only to have gfs, girls and ***ual things rather it can be used to serve nation, transform some one's life, which I must appreciate which u showcased in Bill gates part of visit in the book, the second part of Madhav's life was quite a good, and build a strong career. But the overall impact of the story would definitley not be a career oriented, bright future & absolutely wrong goal impact for young minds.",27,1
8129135728,1,all respect and faith i kept on chetan losses totally in a single day after i reading this book. he writing story for bollywood or what? totally useless. i cant keep quiet and my blood pressure is increasing more and more. since it is social so im not using any harsh words. i cant tolerate yaar. now im in mood to kill any of my dear ones or drink more and die. many used to say chetan writes for youth of india. is this indian youth needs?? pure 3rd rated bollywood masala story..........,50,1
8129135728,1,"As usual from Chetan Bhagat. I see some similarities between Gautham Menon's Vaaranam Aayiram and this novel. Overall, its yet another chetan's book and nothing special",2,1
8129135728,1,"Nothing Much in this book, just like a routine Bollywood love story, the narration very similar to old novels. I did not felt excited in novel anywhere....",2,1
8129135728,4,The story was too predictable from the startThe description of scenes and people specially Riya is quite good.Overall one time good to read.,2,1
8129135728,5,"Excellent and heart touching, I recommend everybody to read. Hats  off to Chetan",7,1
8129135728,1,Terrible!No doubt the concept is great. But the narration as well as the characters are too boring to hook you.Please Dont Buy It!,2,1
8129135728,1,Characters in the book are as shallow as a puddle.I refuse to acknowledge there is a story..the events are predictable.The writing is bland and boring.I have no idea how the overall rating is 4 stars ?!?! If by any chance you came here and read this review thank your lucky stars my friend and RUN away! Its an absolute wasteAfter reading this book i feel lik punching my self for trying it,1,1
8129135728,1,"When I finished reading this book, I had finished reading The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. All I can say is that it sucks. So many coincidences, predictable storyline. I am surprised how somewhat might have agreed to make a movie on such a crippled story. When I compared Half Girlfriend with The Notebook I felt like comparison of Indian made Lava mobile and a well crafted iPhone.",1,1
8129135728,1,"Yes, I had the guts to read this junk because I really didn't have much to do. Firstly, there was nothing wrong with Amazon's delivery or the quality of product. But, reading this made me wonder if I could sue Mr Bhagat for brain damage. This is his worst work so far, if you can call the rest of them ""works"". Please don't read this and save our nation from the clutches of idiocy and corporate sellouts like the ""author"" of this ""masterpiece""! I could return this junk to Amazon I would pay them to burn it and at least 5 more. If he comes up with a sequel called Quarter Girlfriend, I'm leaving this planet.",35,1
8129135728,3,first of all i bought this book from amazon as it was available for Rs100delivey was on timebut it had torn page in the middle as if were a used productapart from that the book is a one time read .its good but one time read ..,40,1
8129135728,2,"Boy meets girl, falls in love with her except she just wants to be friends with him plus they both are from different Indian states.Sounds predictable and what with so many stories already focussing on this theme of social, cultural differences among the various states in the culturally varied India with every second person afflicted with a similar case of ""I love her/him but she/he doesn't love me"", I was reluctant to take up Half Girlfriend but when some of my readers pointed out that I had not reviewed CB's latest and expressed their desire to hear about my thoughts on the book, I decided to go buy the book and read it! :)First things first, I must tell you my previous impressions about CB formed after reading all his previous books. CB is an author who writes simply, knows the issues that are common among the young Indians and has managed to make a place in their hearts. All these things make him respect worthy in my eyes. Coming to his books, I loved 2 States the best among his books and Revolution Twenty20 the least. His books are unpredictable. There is no guarantee that you will like them.Half Girlfriend takes the author's writing journey forward and here too he focuses on the issues that are pretty common and so, will be empathized upon by everyone. The title is intriguing and makes one take a second look at the book while surfing in a bookstore. The blurb is mediocre but with CB, who reads the blurb?We just see his name and pick up the book! :)When I started the book, initially I enjoyed reading about Riya and Madhav and their character development in the first 3-4 chapters. After this everything is the usual with nothing interesting to keep you bound to the book. The story could have been made more crisp, concise and simply more interesting. It drags and the scenarios and the change of places just didn't make me want to stop to take notice.The writing style is simple and can be read by everyone but this book is not meant for serious readers because you, simply, wont like it. If you are an avid CB fan and a casual reader then can give it a try. If you are new to CB then I wont recommend starting the author's book journey with this book.2 out of 5 to Half Girlfriend because I liked the title, the idea behind the book and the character development. The execution of the story fails and the scenes, after the initial part of the book, start looking too far fetched and a drag.This review is also available on my blog Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff",0,0
8129135728,2,"Chetan Bhagat is the bollywood equivalent of books. The story is nothing new. The same old boy meets girl; problems; both get apart; meet again. Voila! Only the setting is different every time, but the basic theme is the same. Go for it if you are in for a light read. Can be easily finished within a couple of days.",1,1
8129135728,3,"Of all of the Chetan Bhagat's stories , this might look the most un real one. It was actually more like a Karan Johar type bollywood drama. Even though it was a fine story, the last part of the book where Madhav found Riya only on his last day in US seemed very unrealistic. First off, you hardly can find people like Madhav who can be so mad in love for a girl and could not forget her even after 2 and half years and secondly running till US with no proper information about the girl and finding it just on the last day of the stay was just over the top.The best part about the book was the story about the school which Madhav and his mother intended to grow and make it a success. The speech that Madhav delivered will give a strong message to all the people reading this book. That is something to be proud of. I wish there could be any 'real' Madhav in today's world who can be so determined and passionate in whatever they wish for- whether it being raising a school in rural India or running behind your love. His character was just amazing!Anyway, overall a nice book. And as always, Chetan Bhagat's book always keep you holding till the end!",12,1

8129135728,5,"I not a reading person. But when I heard about this book ,, I thought of reading it. But I didn't believe that one day I can complete it. First half was very interesting to me .. but I keep lazy in reading it. ( Am not perfect in English like madaav now) but one day I saw my friend bought it's paper version and I saw its the window near where he sleeping. On that day I again thought of reading it . It was about 4 months I stopped reading it . I started again reading it .. on that night I read from the 56 to 70% of this book. And today I complete it .. after I start reading I couldn't stop.. it's like .. watching a movie .. and I didn't know how much time read it .. I gone through the same feelings of Rita and madaav in this book. Thank u Chathan sir for this amazing book.. hats off u..",0,0

8129135728,1,"Half star for CBs Half girlfriend Need I say more?Okay here it goes... apart from the age old cliches this book is just an exact copy of his earlier novels, but in a hideous way. The story like others includes some sports with hardly any connection + Bill Gates out of nowhere. There is absolutely zero depth story wise or character-wise. About writing I can say the language is actually deteriorating in every sense, calling it simple English seems absurd.Main protagonist the non-English type(as CB says) Madhav was like a blessing in disguise for this ridiculous language I guess. I must admit each and every dialog in this book was so pathetic that it made me laugh out loud (well, that 12 star is for all those LOL moments).Looking back now, I dont find any difference between CBs male protagonist Govind, Gopal and now Madhav all are same depos, chepos , self pitting jerks yet behave like innocents in the end and all his female protagonist Vidya, Aarthi and now Riya all are so silly and lame that they always end up taking stupid decisions. There is absolutely no character differentiation amongst them what so ever. On top of that the main characters are always behind the author himself to share their life stories so that he can save them in the end and write an epic story out of it. God, Give me a break!!!!Coming back to 12 Girlfriend how the hell the title is apt for the story I am unable understand. Is it because Riya just allowed despo Madhav to kiss her and refrains him to do anything beyond that, is that it? I dont know how else to justify this stupid title for this awful story.I dont even understand how people are considering this as a Bollywood script(story) in my opinion it shouldnt even be qualifying for that.",39,1

8129135728,4,"Good one time read!!The best thing about all of chetan's work is the simplicity of the his plots, the village scenes.The guy struggling till the last moment, doing anything he can to get this girl back.The best scene according to me was the one when madhav struggles through the snowfall to get to the place where Riya has a performance. No public transport to take him there, the temperature is freezing low.Finally when he reaches the place and gets on to the stage when Riya is performing, Riya opening her eyes and breaking into tears on seeing madhav right in front of her.A good one time read and yes even I felt it was more of a Bollywood script.",0,0

8129135728,1,"I'm a fan of Chetan Bhagat, and enjoyed  Five Point Someone, 2 States  and The 3 Mistakes of my Life, but was disappointed with Half Girlfriend.

All they had in common was basketball. Not amusing or touching like the other books",39,1
8129135728,3,It's purely for entertainment.If you want to read a book just for passing your time then it's good otherwise you will be disappointed.There's nothing new in this story solely written for it to be made into a film.,1,1

8129135728,5,"'Half Girlfriend' - A nice novel from Chetan Bhagat! Much better than his last one. A very good plot, very nice narration and the way the story went from start to finish, through the ups and downs of the protagonist... very good!I was very sceptical about the book after seeing the title as well as the story line in the back cover. Also my experience with 'Revolution 2020' made me wonder whether I should read this book or not! Happy that I decided to give it a try!I can see that Mr. Bhagat is now writing stories in a more script-like manner, tailor-made for movies and I don't see any harm in that! It is written well, and seems so good to be made into a movie without much changes!A good short read whether you are a CB fan or not!",15,1
8129135728,4,Good one to read. And  really thanx to amazon for providing such copy in heavy discount. I also like to mention amazon provided me two book marks with this one and yup those are just a peace of paper but it shows how amazon taking care of things. Another thing about service of amazon my product got delayed due to courier service and they tagged it as 'more information required regarding my address'.

8129135728,2,This book contains typical romantic bulls*** obviously with Chetan Bhagat's utterly Punjabi flavour though none of the characters have any kind of association with Punjab.Writing isn't as crisp as you'd expect from an IIM Grad.This is the first book of Chetan that I've read and next time I'll not give any more space to him in my Bookshelf for sure.Read it only if you're a beginner to novels and trying to find some kind of timepass in reading.And more importantly don't follow his characters in your real love life at any rate because that would certainly spoil everything.,0,0
8129135728,3,Its completely a movie Story.. Chetan bhagat writes a movie Story and not a novel..he might have thought about who will be the actors and actress ..I would rate this as a good book at least for indians like me who don't have a hobby of reading much..buts its after all same as other CB books..there are some flaws in the book likePage 202: Received Whatsapp notification in 2008.. seems Whatsapp released its own version specially for CB's character for testing in 2008 as they released actual version in 2009.and some more like this ,0,0
8129135728,3,"HALF GIRLFRIEND - A love tale of madhav jha from Bihar and Riya a high classy Delhi girl, typical Bollywood style of novel alike other Chetan Bhagat novels. But the things he shared about Bihar and how they still struggles all were noticeable yet I feel like made trail ahead of making Bollywood movie with twists and turns from Patna to USA. Yet recommends to starters for very simple English and easy way of narrating. Not a bad unless the concept like Riya goes to US because of promise made madhav's mom, It could be done better to reach good reviews and good readers.",0,0
8129135728,3,"Chetan Bhagat uses simple English to narrate his story. He keeps the plot easy so that the readers do not find it heavy to remember the names, scenes and happenings. The 260-pages novel is divided into three parts: Delhi, Bihar and New York. The college days is described funnily by the author as he masters in telling college and campus stories. But as soon as the book reaches Bihar, you find a sudden transformation in the writing style and even the story. For the research and minute analysis that Chetan has done on Bihar and the whole culture, attitude and priorities of locals living there should be applauded. The mindset of people living in small towns or non-metro cities is very well portrayed in the 2nd part of the book. Coming to the last part of New York, I found it to be the weakest link in the book because of which I find the book falling down to the mediocre level even when it was moving excellently in its first 2/3rd part. Therefore, the novel neither let the message overcome your previous assumptions (related to class system based on English speaking skills) nor the story impresses you at the end of the tale.  There are few scenes that definitely stay with you: When Madhavs friend asks him to make Bihar proud by sexually involving with his high-notch metro-city girlfriend. How it keeps echoing in his mind that he has to make his state proud makes you laugh. Another moment when Madhav reciprocates to interviewers makes you jump off your seat. CB purposefully inserts scenarios that we wish to do in real life but couldn't and therefore, his story clicks with younger audience. Another thrilling experience is the moment when you realize Riya has disappeared suddenly leaving Madhav behind. Moments like this keeps Half Girlfriend in your hands until you dont finish it off in one go. There are several drawbacks too; biggest being the anti-climax and climax. It is so stretched that you will find yourself skipping pages to find that one page which would give story a final turn. Also, the characters except Madhav and Riya arent being involved much otherwise it could have been more fun finding Madhav fighting against everyones demon of demeaning people with bad English.  Overall, Chetan Bhagat has somehow succeeded in what he wanted to deliver through this book. If you aren't speaking fluent English, you wont be ashamed in future and will give reference of the book to the people/group of people judging you. If you hang around with a girl, kiss her and still, cannot call her your girlfriend, you have got a new term to refer what your relationship with her is. I give this book 3.25/5. I wish climax would have been a bit shorter and better. Half Girlfriend can also be called Book version of Raanjhanaa(Sonam Kapoor statter).",7,1

8129135728,3,"As a foreigner who has never read any works of Chetan Bhagat but has watched the movie Three Idiots, I found it similar in plot to the movie, but still a pleasant pastime. Sure the wording is not that delicate, but it is like what we will say in our daily life but a little more witty. But I don't like the way the author arranged the the story, especially the last part; abruptly changing the storyteller, the last climax being not persuasive enough.Anyway, it's my first attempt to understand Indian pop culture, how should I put it, it's a half success.",0,0
8129135728,3,"Good captivating story. However ..it looks like a film script than a novel. I think the focus was on creating a film than a novel. Although its entertaining.. few things like chetan Bhagat himself being present in story, hero of the film sharing close friendship with other American singer (who eventually helps locate Ray) in spite of his English fears looks a bit unrealistic even by fiction standards.

Of late the approach to buildup is repetitive of his past books (except pre-martial sex). Here too it is passable as the view of young India to the world would change over the period. Much like his central focus to the development of rural India by the fresh generation. The HSBC campus interview is hilarious.

8129135728,4,"Chetan Bhagat, India's paperback king comes forth with another sweet love story after his earlier 2 States.Introduction: The story revolves around a Bihari boy who finds it difficult to survive in the St.Stephen's college due to his tragic English. He enters the college through sports quota and finds another girl who is a rich lad from Delhi. They develop friendship. The boy finds his love. The girl doesn't allow him a relationship but becomes his half girlfriend! The story revolves with the boy trying to convince her his true love with certain ups and downs.Review: The story is highly advised for the first timers reading Chetan Bhagat. However the novel diminishes the quality we saw in Five Point Someone and Three Mistakes. Sometimes you feel like watching a long Bollywood movie. The story starts commonly with girl meeting boy. Boy falls in love first while the case of girl is not clear before. You feel sometimes that the girl is using the boy but sometimes you find true love between them. The boy loves the girl badly. However you have some moments of Bewafaai in the middle and a successful love story in the end.In the middle the writer gives you a picture of rural India showing poverty which disconnects you with the original plot. The writer somehow manages this sequence to connect with the running plot.The storyline revolves around the cities of Delhi, Patna and New York with Dumraon village as the protagonist's hometown. The descriptions of people, surroundings, cities are exceptional.You don't really feel boring while going through the novel.Pros: Simple and lucid language, perfect blend of several story type topics. It makes you emotional many a times and also makes you guffaw at sequential trickles.Cons: When you start reading you find difficult to understand the prologue content as it starts suddenly. The starting of sequences one by one also may trouble you.Summary: The book is good, give it a pick and enjoy!",2,1
8129135728,2,"Long ago, there was this smart guy with a super pedigreed academic background who passed out from the hallowed portals of IIT and IIM Ahmedabad no less, who moonlighted as an author beyond his Investment Banking career.These books were semi-autobiographical, well marketed, compact, written with contemporary India as its landscape, funny at times, focused on youth and their issues, written in simple English...and lakhs of copies were sold....and in a country where a sale of 5000 copies qualifies it as a best-seller, our friend sold in millions....and he did a great service to the reading habits of the current generation of TV/FB / WhatsApp obsessed youth...He revived the dying habit of reading....and got people back to the wonderful worldof books.....some of them were quite interesting ...especially the ones which borrowed heavily from his own life and were semi-autobiographical....Whether it was Five Point Some One, Three Mistakes of my life or 2 States....easy language, the context you can relate to and some of the questions he raised....resonated with our issues and anxieties....not great literary value...but good time pass.Wish he had continued writing these harmless novellas taking bits and pieces of his life and fictionalizing them...and a generation of people who would never read a book in English would have read his books and hopefully got hooked to reading....but Alas....the script doesnt run that way.... ...he became a celebrity...a cult figure... The cheeky smart writer suddenly became the messiah of Change...the literary revolutionary.. ..Mr Know All.....and he became the go-to man for expert comments on all the ills of the society ( and with instant solutions) and he was there all over the news channels / magazines and the topping on the cake was a cover feature in India Today and featuring in TIME magazines list of 100 most influential people.And then the crappy books started...The hubris started with Revolution 2020...and followed by What Young India Wants....both books part of his coming down the hill series. HALF GIRLFRIEND...possibly is his worst offering...( notwithstanding the millions of copies it must be selling)...The story of the Madhav Jha, the Brahmin boy from interior Bihar and his patchy love affair with Riya Somani, the Lutyens Delhi girl from Aurangazeb Road......and the filmy happy ending ( he must have had the movie rights in his mind when he was writing).....is an unbelievable story...contrite and contrived...One wonders where one meets these kind of characters in real life...sorry Mr Bhagat.....this one does not fly.To be fair to the author...he is in his element in some parts...when he writes of the HMTs ( Hindi Medium Types) and their apparent lack of self confidence and self-worth in spite of all their other accomplishments....the protganists interview experience when he trying to get into St. Stephens....this part of the book itself will make it an unqualified best-seller. He still retains his cheeky persona and comes up once in a while with real witty one liners ( The grass in Stephens also grows in English...Stephens being St.Stephens College in Delhi alluding to the ultra-snooty orientation if the Stephenians)..Overall avoidable....wish Mr Bhagat stops hallucinating about being the change agent and get back to what he is good at....writing simple books which are semi-autobiographical in simple English which will sell in the desi-hinterlands. Like the drivel that Ashwin Sanghi and Amish Tripathi publish...they are unapologetic about what they write ...unlike our friend...who wants to transform / reform / change India....thought this was Modis job!",2,1
8129135728,3,"Yet again, Chetan Bhagat has produced a novel that is more a Bollywood script than a novel. The scenes and situations are constructed in such a manner that almost each and every page acts as a shout-out to all the major productions houses of Bollywood. He could very well have added a PS to the book reading something like'I have added all the spice and flavour for another major Romantic Masala Potboiler for the benefit of all the Johars and Chopras of Bollywood. And the bidding starts now'The story is quite simple with a regular Bihari boy falling head over heels in love with a girl totally opposite to him in education, lifestyle and background, which is much in tune with his earlier novel '2 States' where the protagonists are from two completely different backgrounds and have to fight against odds to come together. However, in 'Half Girlfriend', neither do the situations bring out too much of a emotional conflict or turmoil nor does the characterisation come out as an example of finesse. Moreover, some of the scenes, like the one at the end where the Bihari boy manages to locate the girl and approaches her right in the middle of her performance, make you say 'SERIOUSLY!' aloud.It is a good read for those who are not well-read and are not interested in good literature but in an entertaining enough plot to pass time before the movie based on the novel comes out.",2,1

8129135728,4,"Half Girlfriend is full entertainment, would be the first day first show report of the movie based on it. You have seen Chetan Bhagat's books converted to movies but this time it seems screenplay first, before being transformed into a book.To start with, the first half portrays the familiar style of Chetan Bagat to introduce the main characters, how they first meet and how they eventually fall in love, err, half love. It is same with Madhav Jha and Riya Somani just like Krish and Ananya from 2 States or Gopal and Aarti from Revolution 2020 - that first glance, the hesitation in breaking the ice, a common interest, in this case Basketball which plays a good supporting role and a basic barrier which looks like a spoilsport in the could be smooth affair all the way - ""English"" language this time.And how can a love story be complete until there is heartbreak, separation, followed by a tough to bear full of drama life that seems like a backup option to engross and grind you or rather challenge you in such case to just move on, just until the time your paths cross again.Just as when Madhav thinks his life is going great and he has been paid for his patience, for listening to his heart, there is more tragedy with a brilliantly plotted twist when he loses Riya again, and also the hope of not seeing her ever again.Finally, how he becomes third time lucky, how things fell in place and how he got what he deserved and dreamed of right from the start will bring a sense of complete heart warming story.The book is recommended if all through the story you look for an attachment to the emotions which is even more helped by simple, not so intellectual writing that depicts the real life like thinking that one can relate to.

There was nothing new and refreshing in this novel compared to his previous works.When the story began (in the usual Chetan Bhagat cliche manner) I thought this is going to be good. But as I leafed through the pages, my interest was completely gone and anger and irritation started seeping out which was proportional to the number of pages that I completed reading. I finished the last few pages only for the sake of completing it. So much for the hype and pre-order craziness during the launch.CB successfully managed to train wreck this novel(if we can call it that way) and his reputation among Indian youth.

I regret wasting my precious time on this book.To be frank it's a mix of kuch kuch hota hai and forest Gump minus Tom hanks.Dear Chetan Bhagat stop trying too hard to get into Bollywood.The choice of storyline for the first half is to impress karan johar maybe with all the best friends playing basketball stuff.Loosing out on basic logics like whatsapp was launched in 2009 whereas the female protagonist had mentioned in her journals dated 2008 of getting a whatsapp notification.Being an author he should have taken care of such details.Whatever it is not worth the time.,2,1

A enjoyable journey with the character.Story from the point of view of the female protagonist was amazing and shows how one person fail to see other persons' difficultiesI am waiting for a day when main protagonist in a Chetan Bhagat's book will be a woman.I will definitely recommend this book to all,2,1

From start to end I have never felt like I was reading a novel, instead I was reading the screenplay of a traditional Bollywood masala movie.

I believe Half Girlfriend is a coming of age book for Chetan Bhagat. It retains the guilty pleasure feel from his earlier novels while providing some insightful commentary about rural education, English, development, politics and love reminiscent of his editorials. The commentary is centered around the protagonist Madhav and Bihar but is generally applicable to a variety of similar situations as well.In Madhav, Chetan has created yet another character that everyone will root for. This is going to make one hell of a movie script! Thanks for mentioning one of my favourite songs.Playing ""A Thousand Years"" by Christina Perri on loop.",10,1

8129135728,4,"Well I got this book and just finally finished it....after reading it I just amazed.....how simple is the writing style of Chetan Bhagat sir.About story line, the plot is simple..just like a movie.....like Village and Town diffrences......In this story its narrated that Madhav had problem about spoken english......but how he survived in New York in 3 weeks without any english problem??The book name is HALF GIRLFIREND......but when you will read this book, you will come to know that Madhav got all the benefits as a Half Boyfriend even a Full Boyfriend couldn't get all those things. But Madhav is so much Horny :(....I liked the character Riya :)So much twist and turnings :(But I mostly liked the lines in between which Chetan sir has mentioned them individually. :)In between some incidents are there which you will read but you can't the book down...So much interesting and heartwarming things.After all that I liked it.... :)Thank you Chetan sir and Amazon :)",1,1
8129135728,2,"I declare that I am using this review as an excuse to use the word half in as many ways as possible, which is more than half-bad, like the book.How can I describe Chetan Bhagats (CBs) half-girlfriend? It is half a film script stretched into a book about one and a half times longer than his earlier novels, about one and a half times as costly, with the font proportionately smaller (to minimize the page count and cost).This is the story of a Bhojpuri royal who wants to make a girl his better half, but she only agrees to be his half-girlfriend (meaning no pleasurable mutual physical activity involving her socket(s) and his cylinder and no artificial respiration exercises). Then they attend college, play basketball, she marries somebody else, then Bill Gates comes, then she gets cancer, then...This half-hearted, half-baked, half-cocked, half-cooked, half-crazy, half-a-climax (no, not climax as in orgasm), half-and-half (half-novel, half-movie script), half-edited novel is best forgotten. (You may have realized I never do anything by halves ha ha. But if I have half a mind to finish something, I try to do so.)Without trying to be too clever by half and with half my mind on this half-read book, I found rifled used instead of riffled; male athlete students are men, but female athlete students are girls, not women; conversion rates of USD to INR fluctuate without logic; wretched language alternates with sophisticated words the protagonist would never have used; Hindi and Bhojpuri words are used profusely but rarely translated (so the book is not meant for people unfamiliar with Hindi and Bhojpuri, including Madrasis); sophisticated foods are named in foreign languages and again not translated (so this book is only for readers familiar with Hindi, Bhojpuri and these languages); and so on ad infinitum (hence the term half-edited).",1,1
8129135728,3,"I read a lot but have been a bit of an elitist as far as reading Indian Authors are concerned. I don't have any good reason why. Maybe because I hated Arundhati Roy's ""God of Small Things"" but ever since I read Rohinton Mistry's ""A Fine Balance"" I think there has been a surge in my interest. I am now willing to give Indian authors a try. Half Girlfriend is my first book by Chetan Bhagat. What do I know about him? He is very famous and wrote the book the wonderful 3 idiots is based on.What is impressive about Half Girlfriend is that I can't genuinely feel robbed of my time. Ok to say that a demerit exists is not exactly helpful I know but what I want to say is that the book is very true to its words despite describing a city like Delhi. I went to North Campus so I vaguely related with the book. The description of St. Stephens, the notoriety of the rich girls, the unmistakable storytelling ability of the author, the description of New York was outstanding I thought. I haven't been to Bihar but I'm sure he described it really well.I respect the book because it never takes a sorrowful course to prove its significance. Chetan is very easy to read, he is no Aravind Adiga but he has his moments of making you want to read on. I read this book in one day.What I disliked about the book - It was simple and predictable at times. Overall I will never think of this book in the future and say wow, something was gained by this. Its so normal and self satisfied.  I also didn't find the whole ""Looking for alaska"" style of ""dating"" very cool. I wish the characters were more interesting. I mean I'm one heck of an interesting guy..the book had noone like me, maybe Rohan :PConclusion - Easy to read, you'll finish it very fast, not too taxing...full marks for a great title which will sell this book. Also Chetan makes it interesting for me to consider writing as an art form and now my curiosity has been piqued. Excellent description of life in Delhi and NYC.",1,1
8129135728,3,"The novel is okay. I read all Chetan Bhagat's books religiously, even re-read some of his works from time to time because I enjoy them. He adds a twist of humor to any situation which I particulaly liked. But lately, his works got more serious, I appreciate that, but at the same time think they are lacking in creating much intrigue. His narration used to be light-hearted, yet conveyed a motivating message at the end. This story lacks both on the subtle humor & message fronts (Its just a story I know, but just mentioning my thoughts on it). Its gets tedious/dragged out after a point, I mean how long can the female-lead toy with hero's emotions and yet never commit or at least let him go, it comes across as selfish. The story hints that she's had an abusive past (am I right on this point?), but her behaviour is odd (she still allows/enjoys some intimacy, fully knowing what it could lead to...strange!!), its hard to sympathize with her. It seems to me that she never gave the guy much importance, she flitted in & out of his life as she pleased. Considering this, the hero's obsession with her IMO, seems unreasonable and over-the-top, for they didn't even have a proper relationship (I have to tag it as one of those love-at-first sight things). And yes, the climax is dramatic and resembles a cliched bollywood ending. Not impressive. The only part I liked about him is the way he worked for the school's development back in his village. I did not like, nor could relate to any other characters in this story. So that's about it. And YET, eagerly awaiting your next story Chetan, please bring back your old style.",1,1
8129135728,3,"HUGE SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING!Did I LOVE this book? No. Did I LOATHE it then? No. Am I crazy? NO.I was so confused as to how i was going to review this book because i had mixed feelings. But i can say one thing for sure, this was the only book by Chetan Bhagat i could stand!! I like him as a writer (LOVE actually) but his stories never really get to me)Anyway, This book was about a guy called Madhav. He comes from a ""not so royal anymore"" royal family from the state of Bihar. Bihar is one of the most backward states in India and is generally looked down upon by many. Since he lived in Bihar most of his life his english is pretty screwed up and I for one am not the judgmental type when it comes to not knowing english, and i also thought this book was better because of this detail. SO when he goes to New Delhi, for college (to the best college in India actually) he is made fun of for his spoken english. This is where he meets Riya, a tall, Beautiful girl who just like him plays basket ball for the collage team. They get talking and eventually become reallllyyyy close. But wait there is one problem, according to her it was just friendship but according to him it was just LOVE, hmmm not the first time you have seen a guy friendzoned. This guy decides to take it to another level, he kisses her, keeps DESPERATELY BEGGING her to love him back, even if she keeps brushing him off. and all i wanted to say was.. "" Hey i just found this on the ground, it looks like your DIGNITY, you better hang on to that!""It wasnt just his fault.... No. It was her fault as well, even if the guy u friendzoned kisses u and asks to for more u say ""NO."" but that is not what Ms. Riya does, she leads him on. She makes him hungry for more and she goes to his room after playin basket ball cuz she wants a nap...!so when she goes to his house to rest, he gets all horny and she says ""no I am not comfortable with this, blah blah blah..."" and he LITERALLY says "" **** me or **** off"" so she gets offended and tells him that she doesnt want to be friends anymore. He goes to apologize but she tells him that she was getting married to her family friend Rohan. and dropping out of collage So guess what he is heart broken.The book actually got better and better. Madhav though not fully recovered from his heart break , goes back to his village to help run a village school which was started by his mother to provide free education to the poor. He meets divorced Riya again and she offers him help with his english as he had to make a speech for BILL GATES who was coming on a visit to India for sponsoring organisations working for the society's betterment. He needed a speech that convinces Gates foundation to provide him the grant.The whole part from here, INSPIRED me a lot! It dealt with major issues that India faces today and how we can achieve anything with determination and hard work. It really touched me, how much of suffering ppl in Indian villages face, especially the kids. This book was really really really making me LOVE !This is again when it started going down again! He gets the grant and when he looks around for Riya she disappears leaving him a letter saying she has lung cancer and that she has only a little time left and not to come look for her. He is hear broken again. (view spoiler)Its like Chetan Bhagat couldn't think about any other reason so just put up the first thing that came to his mind! *throws stone at random pedestrian*He remembers that it was always her dream to sing in the bars of NYC and goes there looking for her!! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SENSES (If u ever had any , that is.) NEW YORK IS NOT A GROCERY STORE, where u can look for ur mom in case u lose her.*face palms so hard that her face is completely flat now*He finds her nevertheless and she says she did it cause she was scared of commitment.....Also at the end I figured out that the ""not knowing english"" was just left there hanging in mid air. I thought this aspect ,if it were made use of in a more substantial way would have made it a little more interesting.So the book wraps up with a happily ever after. He gets the girl, he gets the kid!",1,1
8129135728,3,"I did not plan to buy this going by the reviews. However, I happened to notice it on sale at a throwaway price along with the other books I ordered. Why not ?I should probably read everything and broaden my horizons (even if it is on the other side) and become more tolerable. As luck would have it, I had a major migraine for 3 days in a row and couldn't really focus on anything. So there is a book that wouldn't require me using my head much. Is it really a book ? Maybe just a Bollywood script:I could finish it in about 5 hours maybe lesser if not for the headache.So, I agree, it is not a unique book.It is not really a book I would read again.It is exactly like any other Chetan Bhagat book.What's new ? - The characters and the setting. New names of people.Delhi,Bihar and New York instead of Varanasi.What's old? - Everything else.But I have managed to watch every Shahrukh khan movie even when most of them used to have similar stories. So with Chetan Bhagat's books.The good things- Sentimentalism and drama keeps you hooked(Bollywood, right? minus the music)The bad thing?- Repetition ( I specifically recall a few sentences in a dialogue which go in the same way in 2 states and Revolution 2020) But of course, same author. Maybe this is his signature style. Only some people can like cheesy romantic movies. Probably not for everyone.However, I really want Chetan to stop meeting the main characters at the beginning and the end of his books. WHY? Why is it so necessary to bring yourself in ? In this one, it did not even make sense. Why would Madhav come up to the author's hotel and dump Riya' journals on him ? Why not on anyone else?About the copy: I bought it for 43 rupees. Free home delivery. It's not great. It's not bad either. One of the pages was out-of-size. But its no big deal for 43 rupees.",1,1
8129135728,4,"Once upon a time, there was a Bihari boy called Madhav. He fell in love with a rich girl from Delhi called Riya. Madhav did not speak English well. Riya did. Madhav wanted a relationship. Riya didn't. Riya just wanted friendship. Madhav didn't. Riya suggested a compromise. She agreed to be his half-girlfriend.Is this a book or a screen play is what kept confusing me while I was reading this book. In fact I could see someone like Arjun/ Ranveer playing Madhav and Deepika playing a Ria. This is a book with the complete dialogues of a movie, sentence after sentence. Every page of the book feels like it has been written to be made into a movie. So much that the book is separated into three sections called Acts.Talking about the book, it is very much in the genre of the authors previous offerings. Boy meets girl in a cool campus (moving away from the IIT/ IIM to Stephens, probably in an attempt to widen the reader base), and falls in love. Add some drama, a little sex (must in a CB book), whole lot of daily life situations and some emotionally moving dialogues. You have a story ready.There is not much relevance of the title in the book, and it seems more a ploy to fulfil the authors fetish obsession with numbers (all his books have a number in them). Also, as it was touted in the media, there is not much relevance of the Language divide  those who know English and those who dont. This again seems like a concept that has been force fitted into the theme of the book, to make it relevant to the present day reader. This is one thing that Chetan Bhagat needs to be given complete credit for. He knows the pulse of the nation and what the present day youth is thinking. He knows their fears and the dreams, and the daily challenges they face.Every young person, from a small town would completely relate to the main protagonist of the book, due to the language embarrassment that he is shown to face. Also, the author has a knack for fleshing out the daily observations in the most comic manner possible.Gems like, I think when rich guys say something, girls find it extra funny, When two women dont share the right vibe, a peaceful hour together is a minor miracle etc.Overall, this book, like other books from the author, is an easy read, and pretty run of the mill kinds, Though many elitists would deny having read this book, I am sure everyone would go ahead and read it.Like it is rightly said about Chetan Bhagat, he truly is the Salman Khan of the literary world. Happy reading!!!",1,1
8129135728,1,"Chetan! Chetan! Who are you?Where are you headed, do you have a clue?I bought your book and read it through,Trust me dear, there is nothing new!A horny hero and a pretty heroine,A prestigious college, stereotypic routine!The story line is an absolute miss,Front page ad in TOI, for a book like this?The back cover talks about Hindi and English,All that is just plain marketing rubbish.This book breaks no language differences,Hasnt even escaped Bhagats prejudiced preferences.I loved you once when you wrote good fun.Best of all, Five Point Someone.Since then you are stooping to your lowest low,Half Girlfriend, your final blow?Same story twice, can be an honest mistake.But three and four times? Give me a break!Name your leads and share your location,I can write your next story to Bhagats perfection.Simple English is my style,Says Chetan Bhagat all the time.I am happy with that, totally fine.But excuse me mister, where is the storyline?Your sexist one-liners are witty no more,Dont you remember, youve told them before?You claim that your writing is for the rich to the slums,They have better IQs than that, dont underestimate them.You are an author who could have been!Youve let it go for the silver screen.Are you trying to increase you reader hood?Or simply selling out to Bollywood?There have been authors just like you,Whove written good books and screenplays too.But youve got too carried away and lost the act,And quoting your Alma matter to hide that fact.Chetan O Chetan, Where are you?I am not an elitist, I used to really like you.Give us simple but also different and new.Slow your star-chase and get real dude!",1,1

And would like to request them not to comment on any of his novel in future. It deserves 5 star or more. Generally people say on most social networking  sides that he lacks in grammar but I really don't  know what high quality grammar really mean. Who the hell is reading the book for grammar except the character in this book. I found one mistake in the  book but &  I think, I should mention it.  It's on page no 202, it's mentioned ""A WhatsApp message flashed in the notifications"", the date mentioned is 11 July 2008. But from Wikipedia I know WhatsApp was introduced only after 2009.

I was into one of John Green's when I stopped it to read this one out of curiosity.It was pathetic boring.The storyline is sorta mess, nothing's rightly directioned to fit young Indian readers. If you really are interested on exploring this genre of Romantic Indian Fiction then Novoneel Chakraborty would give you a blissful reading period.The only thing that would work for Mr.Bhagat would be the titles he inscribes to his book, which I don't think fitted this book properly as it was hardly a page turning love story but a one with a horny protagonist and a seemingly unfitting storyline.I'm repeating storyline many times in this review so that at least it can fulfill what the book lacks...

8129135728,3,"Since most Chetan Bhagat books eventually do become Bollywood movies and make him even more rich :), he probably was inspired to script it before hand making it easier for the script writers chosen to create the movie in the future. While the book's write carries the usual CB reader raves such as being written in simple language, being common enough to identify with, etc.. the plot does feel a lot bollywoodish. Also, it doesn't inspire the reader to imagine much beyond or outside today's typical love story with its twists and turns. It may be worth reading once if you have the time. Otherwise, you can just wait for ""Adhi Girlfriend"" to hit the screens in next few years, watch it then. You will not miss anything between the book and the movie like you do when you read some great fiction books concerning middle earth or the JK rowling series and then watch the movies.",1,1

Throughout the book i could not connect with the characters even once, it was just like reading a script of an upcoming movie. This might become a really good movie (Deepika and Arjun as they say) but as a book its a flop. From a author of books like 5point and 2 states i expected something that could keep me engrossed but i believe i shld have trusted Revolution 2020 and shouldn't have had any expectation.2- Mr Bhagat , please stop publishing books just for promoting an upcoming movie of urs,.. it's not wrong when people say that once you commercialize your talent all that counts is Money. feeling disappointed.",1,1

8129135728,1,"After reading books like Five Point Someone , 2 states and 3 mistakes of my life , I really used to have a lot of expectations from Chetan Bhagat. But his standard started coming down from Revolution 2020. And finally to this! I had never dreamt that a writer , who once used to be treated as the youth icon, can write such trash as this. It seems he has written some bollywood script for some 2 star bollywood director!! A script which has already been made a movie earlier!! Chetan Bhagat- I really admire you as a person. Please dont ruin your image like this in front of us. If you dont have any concept or plot to write a book , then please atleast dont write craps like this. Maintain some dignity while writing.",1,1

8129135728,4,"half girlfriend, for me a much awaited book from Chetan Bhagat. After reading Revolution 2020, I thought of reading atleast some better. But this time, I must say that I am disappointed reading this book. The book, more or less, seems like some kind of bollywood script. Everything happening in the book is well interprited. It seems like whole idea has been copied from bollywood movies. Reading this book was no more fun. I am sorry to say that I am highly disappointed from you, Chetan. This is not the thing you are known for...Do read it guys and you will know.For amazon.in:Very Good service from amazon team. I got the book on time in a very good packing. Thanks.",1,1

8129135728,1,"The story starts off okay.. but as it progressed, all I was thinking was when ia the book getting over. Chetan Bhagat is just going down with each novel. He doesn't write novels like Five Point Someone anymore.Since all his novels are made into movies, he has started to write like a bollywood screenplay writer rather than a fiction novel author.  This story would make for a good hindi cinema, considering the lame story line in the latter half of the book.. where else would one run almost 6 miles on a frozen winter night with heavy snowfall.personally, I did not like this book as much as his earlier ones. I maybbe saying goodbye to Chetan Bhagat forever,  aafter this disaster! !!",1,1

Even those having Hindi as their mother tngue act funny in such situations and pretend indifference. Also the differences of classes, gender, social backgrounds and cultures, likes and hatreds, driven to wall situations are very well portrayed. A crisp choice of chaste words from a rich vocabulary, a matured style of narration keep the interest on and on. Onlyan idiot would dislike this great novel!",1,1

Also, its not like Riya rejects Madhav because he cannot speak English as mentioned in the paper back. The ability (or disability) to speak english language and issues around it is touched upon only in couple of chapters and rest are normal love story. Further the plot is very simple and its quite predictable as to what to expect in next chapter.Quite disappointing.",1,1

8129135728,4,First of all thanks to chetan to pull his thoughts below iit and iim .. This time it is DU's St. Stephens.Another typical love story from CB. Starting with the title.. Half Girlfriend..the phrase itself has been used only 3 or 4 times in the book n killing our imagination regarding the plot it says something else. Story simply describes the affection n love irrespective of too widened class difference and the deep dedication of protagonist to win over the fact of impossible love story.Try it if U like climax type ends.It won't take much time...

8129135728,5,Great story. Firstly I got disappointed after reading that Madhav told Chetan Bhagat about Riya's death which was a suspense for me but after that riya's journals came into the picture which chetan bhagat insists madhav to read it & that was a crucial part of the story as Madhav started his journey to find Riya and he did it. Well done. Keep it up Chetan Bhagat.,1,1

8129135728,3,"First of all, let me congratulate Chetan Bhagat for completing 10 years in writing and more importantly, making an impact on young indian minds.Good Writers' works are being made as movies.  Once these are successful, the style of these writers change to suit the movie making.  In English, Michael Crichton style totally changed after Jurassic Park.Chetan Bhagat would have definitely had movie making in his mind in authoring HGF.  The recent flick starts in Stephen's College, Delhi - dwells in Bihar -  with a cinematic end in Manhattan/New York.  This is about the obsessed love life of Madhav(Bihar) with  friendly natured Riya (Delhi).  The author himself plays a brief but a very important role in Madhav'slove life.Chetan took inspiration from evergreen Devdas for true and obsessed love of Madhav - added young indian flavor - with lot of inspiration and hope.As said, his recent flick has all cinematic elements to it - love at first sight, a guy looking for love and the girl yearning for friendhsip, kisses, subtle references to sex, mother-son relationship, a corrupt state, a social cause, and finally a little dose of English Vinglish.  But, humor is missing in HGF.Chetan's first two novels as an author was very impressive.  With so much of commercial aspects in the last three, The author got lost (no offence is intended).  HGF is not different from the last three. Period.  However, Chetan's success lies in compelling you to read his flicks.  I took this yesterday night and completed today morning - a record time for me :-)But, Madhav in HGF makes you to think after reading the story.  His struggle in hi-fi college, his attempts in english speaking, his leaving of lucrative offer for a social cause, his struggle in rebuilding his family school, his values in maintaining the culture (one on one relationship), and finally 'don't, don't give up' attitude need a special mention.  If this is understood by the young indians, the change is for good for future India.I heard that HGF is being made as movie.  You can wait to watch in movie hall.  I suggest you grab a copy, live through the love life of Madhav and get little hope and inspiration.PS:There are no words to describe Amazon's operating mechanism.First, they offered me at INR 99 :-DThe book was about to be delivered on Sunday (as per SMS/mail) but I did not receive till evening.  I was wondering how such a miss(mess?) by Amazon.  But, my predictions went wrong and it was delivered at my door steps at 7.00 PM IST :-)Kudos to Amazon!",0,0
8129135728,4,New young and energized writer Chetan boom again. It is fantasy like dream if we try to attempt them hearty. Chetan try to reveal how English is became a problem for rural Indian. He is also trying the desire of Riya who belongs a rich family. In climax of novel try to use Bilgates to make interesting. Story and story board of chetan work like a movie. He and Ekta announced them too. Including the name of hit and blockbuster for a novel it is strange. Chetan used such word for himself in his marketing strategy. One thing also here to be included that chetan suggest to his audience to read his novel for learning English. He is also trying present what is the main problem in development of rural India. He does it with better research. For it he travel to bihar. Finally Chetan does almost to new and young indian to learn books in the age of Facebook and twitter. Almost he have done it. In the end we can say Chetan bhagat is Salman khan of writing. He is writer of Google generation and he is the actor.,0,0
8129135728,2,"If you are the one who prefer watching Bollywood type lovestories, you are the one who will enjoy reading Chetan Bhagats Half Girlfiend. The blockbuster writer is as usual again successful in keeping you hooked in his story. The writing skills are excellent as if written for a reader who has extremely low level of understanding English, but for all those who enjoy reading work of masters, it is a sweet treat of Happy Ending.What you should look for 1. If you are reading this book, acknowledgement is a must read part. It makes the mood of entire setting.2. It is written after studying minute details of culture and geography.3. You may encounter reading about some well known personalities, you least expected here.4. Bihar is the better part than Delhi, it is where the story has interesting hues.5. The incidents you think have no relevance, eventually give strength to the story.6. You may tempt to eat Litti Chokha as soon as you finish this book.7. You will get some good guidelines on how to learn English.So, ignore a few flaws and enjoy reading this fiction.",0,0
8129135728,4,"It's actually a good book .To start with, I must admit that Half Girlfriend is a definite improvement in terms of the style of writing and manner of narration from all Chetan Bhagat books so far and wants you to keep reading the book till the end. If you are the one who likes romantic bollywood movies , then definitely go ahead and buy it .Though some might not like the fact that the book drags the story a little and you tend to get lost in the middle and the reader tries to think why this portion of story was even there . There are some grammatical errors in the book and some words are also misspelled (May be in my version of the novel)The characters are depicted in a very filmy manner , talking about films as most of us know , now there is a movie coming up in bollywood inspired by Half Girlfriend .It is a sweet romantic novel but somewhere in the middle it looses the charm a bit .The price at which the book is selling at Amazon it should be a must buy .

This reviewer is setting it down here, so that he can try breaking out of it and stop crowding out other better-written books.The Conception:1. He has convinced himself that he is supposed to be the common man's author2. So has a responsibility to pick up mundane topics and themes3. And they have to be cliched and not too intricate - because the common man's life is just not complicated enough for a Dostoevskian treatment (god forbid!), or for a ""literary treatment""4. So it has to be non-literary and cliched. Got it?5. It also has to employ poor language because not only is he the common man's voice, but his readers are also the common men, who wants the processed goods, the easy stuff.6. Conclusion: He has the recipe for an untapped new brand of literature - exploring the lives of the common men of India. Genius Idea. Surely.7. Sounds quite grand, if you ask him!The Execution:1. Having worked out his grand role thus, this self-appointed common man's author sits down to write.2. He doesn't realize this, but the role he has assigned makes it very easy for him to crank out book after book with almost minimal effort.3. He might be able to finish an entire plot in one sitting. After all exposing cliches as reality (without getting into the complexities that make them a part of life) is his role.4. He is surprised at the ease with which he is able to do this. His characters just seem to spring out of nowhere and fade into nothingness between the covers, doing exactly what he bids them in between. Complete mastery. Which author can boast of that?5. Conclusion: Must be a genius.( Bonus: He discovers that he is now also an expert in every national issue and can pontificate effortlessly. He does not realize that anyone can have an opinion, and by being allowed to mouth off on them, he is not being treated like an expert, but as a celebrity. Being a celebrity in this country is license to be an expert on anything, and he gets disproportionate voice in the media, though usually a shrill and mildly pompous one. He becomes hated by the intellectual community of the country for this. Geniuses are always hated, right? Hence conclusion is reinforced",0,0
8129135728,2,"Chetan Bhagat integrates a vital and social issue of access to toilets in rural areas in this story. Chetan has a history of weaving a story line along with a well known but poorly understood issues in all his novels.My problem though is that he has developed an operating style that is tiring out his readers. Love, Lust, Girlfriend , Sex, Marriage + a social issue is a standard process.He NEEDS TO EVOLVE IMMEDIATELY - his talent is not diminished but he WILL HIMSELF A BIG FAVOR by improvising his literary style. A good perspective for him to understand is by looking at how Michael Lewis has evolved his writing style over the years. Comparisons are due here: Both left their lucrative jobs to pursue something they are passionate about ; Both had blockbuster openings in their new chosen career . And thats where the similarities end.Michael went on to write much deeper books including Moneyball,Boomerang, Money culture , The  new new thing , The big short and several others. Presumably almost all of them were centered around financial industry but he did pursue a different theme every time.Chetan is repeating himself and does huge disservice to several of his fans. I am sure he can do reflective thinking and realize his full potential by boldly venturing into territories that will continue to challenge our own thinking  in several ways.",0,0
8129135728,5,"I just started reading at 2pm soon after getting the book delivered as I wanna read only one page but after reading 3 pages{PROLOUGE} I fall in love with the love that Madahv Jha had.....and get curious to know what to happen next. I have to go Multiplex to watch Happy New Year that day but I just call my friend to take my place & enjoy the movie so that my ticket don't go waste. Then I continue to read till 1.47 am. First time my mom told me while reading that ""Can you skip it & continue tomorrow"" . Seriously this is my gifted novel and also the first one....Really reading this novel make me realize that NOVEL ROCKS...especially Chetan Bhagat's novel.In short I am telling#Story is filmy but love story is always filmy got it, you understand only when you too have a love story.#People like me who is fond of movies take a break for this HALF GIRLFRIEND is very remarkable for my age(18).It shows that Chetan sir can do anything by writing.#In whole Act I put myself as Madhav so I can realize the guilty,foolishness and stated a pain on heart I began to cry after reading the sentence  ""love me or leave me"", It is the situation that makes the reality of novel to existing world .#The novel shows the deep reality of real love, curiousness towards love,stupidity in love.Thanks for reading if someone get hurt or dislike this I am sorry for that & have a charming day.-Avi",0,0

8129135728,4,"The review is only about the book and not about the quality of Amazon delivery.I think this is Chetan Bhagat's best book after Five point someone, on par with 2 states. He has a great way of connecting with the middle class youth of India which is continued here as well !The initial portions of the book are really good, and the campus part was really good. Unlike the his previous stories ( Except 2 states ) the heroines were simple characters, but here things have changed. She is complex, loving, and beautiful whereas the hero is a typical lower middle class teenager. The story gets slower when things get back to Bihar, but is still good enough to hold your attention. Chetan takes a dig at the political system every now and then.Things get further interesting when they meet again, and we get a more mature relationship here. In the whole book wherever she is present, it really sparks the story. The best part of the story was her diary pages !It should have been better if the story had stopped right after the diary , but the writer goes on with the story only to deliver a cliche bollywood style ending. The last portions were really dragging, and we would somehow want the story to end",0,0
8129135728,5,"Among all the novels I have read in my entire life, I would like to rank Half Girlfriend on 2nd place preceded by I Too Had A Love Story.However I Too Had A Love Story was a true story. But if I consider fiction, Half girlfriend is the best ever.One of the best book I have  ever read. Chetan is at his best in this book. He is an incredibly talented and a great author. He knows how to create emotion. Like I Too  Had A Love Story, I again put myself in the main character's shoes in Half Girlfriend. After Ravinder Singh, now I have become a fan of Chetan after this work of him. Among all those happy ending stories, it's the best. It made me laugh, smile, sad, cry, pity, angry and finally smile again in the end while reading. Uniquely written it is. It seems like a story of Bollywood movie too. It must be adapted to a movie. While you read it, you might predict the end part. But you will find it completely different. In fact a touching one.If you are not buying/reading this book, you really are missing something in your life.",0,0
8129135728,3,"I think Chetan Bhagat gets way more stick than he deserves. The truth is, he writes and India reads. Most of his criticism stems from the purists or the ""hard-core literature fans"" who can't stand the fact that he is the most popular writer from India. Yes, his writing style is nothing compared to an Ayn Rand, a Rohinton Mistry or a Khaled Hosseini, but someone who is selling so much must be doing something right. And he is.Bhagat always takes up issues which resonate with the masses. In Half Girlfriend, the protagonist is a Bihari guy named Madhav who has a hard time speaking English. Now what can be more common than that? I can envision thousands of youth in Bihar, who will never read ""To Kill a Mocking Bird"", but who will readily see themselves in Madhav and will have no difficulty in comprehending Bhagat's simplistic yet charming writing style. The beauty of this process is, some, if not many, will start seeing reading in a different light and will become become readers for life (Hopefully picking up books with more intellectual depth and profound life lessons). This, I feel, is Bhagat's biggest contribution. The repeated references to Madhav's poor English is annoying at times, but almost every book has a phase where the reader fights within himself to either put it down or soldier along. I chose to read on. And the book did hold my attention. Till the last page. And mind you, I am not a guy who reads ""Only Chetan Bhagat Novels"". I have read my fair share of classics and some have bored me to death. Half Girlfriend had me hooked. Its a charming love story. You will end up rooting for Madhav (Well, if you don't hold a blinkered opinion of Bhagat's work, that is).There is the inevitable drama. Almost Bollywood like. But it is Chetan Bhagat we are talking about. Will you ever dare to criticise Khaled Hosseini for describing the beauty of Afghanistan? Will you lambast Dan Brown for going into minute details of Roman Architecture? Well, no. You will just say that its their own style. This slightly surreal drama is Bhagat's style. And its good. He has his own niche. It's a different story altogether that a new ""generation"" of young writers flourished in India after Five Point Someone, trying to imitate Bhagat's style and ended up hurting his already many times questioned reputation. Bhagat touches on the problem of rural education in India and the book also suggests ways to improve one's English. The techniques may seem too raw for the average Goodreads user or a regular reader, but in truth, they are effective. A 15 year boy reading this book in Bihar will understand this more than you and I will ever will.Half Girlfriend is a very good read. Unputdownable. A sweet love story. An avid reader can easily finish it in two-three sessions. It will be lapped up by India's youth. It is a bestseller for sure. Chetan Bhagat's legend becomes stronger. I just hope that people digest the fact that he is a good writer who knows his strengths and sticks by them.Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armour yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.Kudos to Bhagat for going on despite all the criticism. You Sir, have all my respect.(From a fan who has read enough books to not be classified as a ""Only Chetan Bhagat books guy."")",0,0

I am an avid reader and have never left any book unread or half way. I finish a book of around 250 pages in 5 hours.HOWEVER, this book?? - I never felt like finishing it. It was such a drag from the start and I guess I took THREE Days to get to the last page. And THAT was only to maintain my own record of ""never leaving a book unread"".No content. No Storyline. No humor. Below average English. No ""message to the mass"" through the story. Title and the story dont match.Sincere advice to Chetan: Boss. PLEASE GET BACK TO YOUR OLD SELF, like you were when you wrote ""five point someone"". That book was ""out of the world"". I guess, now, people get your books, only because its written by ""YOU"". But how long? If you dont get back to your ""great writing self"" sooner, you are bound to loose your fans. Please dont try your luck any harder.",2,1

8129135728,3,"To be very frank I found the the book a bit stretched. Too much of the first half was spent on kissing attempts, friendly advises on how to grab your chance with a girl and all that stuff which I think will be added to the movie(I know one is coming up very soon). Hence so much heavy detailing of the half whatever relationship wasn't required I guess. The story begins only when the journals are disclosed and by that time one completely gets tired thinking is there any end to this filmy story. Also this point comes in the 198th or something page....so you can guess how far stretched this book is. And like all Chetan Bhagat books  you get a hero who gets it all - a great school aided by Gates Foundation, a hot wife, caring friends but is as clueless as ever till the epilogue comes around :P. However I found it slight better than Revolution 2020 did not seem like a love story at all.",0,0

8129135728,5,"I don't understand why so many are telling this story is full of factions and many things related to story is unacceptable, the kind thought procedure through which each individual  goes fully is independent to each and everyone. 5 main flaws and all which are highlighted in other websites are as per their view, i would say just read the book and have your own view!book felt a usual one upto 60 pages when i feared whether the reviews were telling te truth that this wasn't upto the level expected,but beyond that i couldn't resist myself from being turning page one after defying my sleep even! . I would say a good story from chetan bagat, nice and fast delivery from amazon.page quality is quite a little low. but that doesn't mater, of-course nobody is going to showcase the book, once read; its finished, so i guess its ok, Eventually you are getting the book at very cheap rice also. i would",2,1

8129135728,5,"Chetan Bagat is known for his novels, most of which are based on college lives. It's always the same 'ol tale that we all know.BUT, Chetan Bhagat's Half Girlfriend, although keeping the same basic outline, manages a story that is so unique you wanna read it again and again. The slow twists and turns, the secrets, the plot, the setting, the adventure, the mystery, the list goes on and on, but this book is over flowing with everything! Wow! The grammar used could have been of a higher quality, but, nevertheless, it managed to bring out the deepest of feelings and emotions out of the characters. An awesome read! It definitely is going to give you an adrenaline rush! I couldn't wait, so finished the book in 2 days!One of the best books by Chetan!A MUST READ!",0,0

8129135728,2,"The book was a decent read. Chetan Bhagat seems to targeting the same college love angle. Chetan was probably in a hurry writing this book to get it out in time. He again might have been thinking that one of the hindi movie producers will pick up this book.The protagonist was a horny young guy who had only one thing in his mind all the time. I think it is ok to be horny at that age but this guy could only think of one thing, like his mind was shut to everything outside of this. Dont know what the girl liked in him and why was she at all attracted towards him.Anyways it was an easy read and was able to complete this in one sitting.",0,0

8129135728,5,"Phheww!! This one was damn fast. 8th novel ""half-girlfriend"", finally through with it. To hell with all those who told me that they didn't find the book interesting, it's bad, it's not worth reading. what i say is. ""A really Beautiful story, the aww and amazing moments between Madhav and Riya. A book which takes the readers through all the highs and lows and realities of life. A story that's filled with sudden tragedies one faces. Everything is Unexpected. We just have to welcome n live every phase in our life."". HATSOFF !! CHETAN BHAGAT. WHAT A CLASSIC LOVE STORY. :) (y)",0,0
8129135728,1,"I really think this novel was a waste of money. I mean Chetan Bhagat is still stuck at pretty basic and naive love story.He could have made this novel a bit more interesting.You may like reading it if you enjoy Chetan Bhagat.But personally suggesting, dont buy it, total waste of money and time.The story is about a desperate guy from Bihar whose main aim is to kiss the leading lady of this novel and learn some good English. Nothing else. A part of Bill Gates is pressed into this book without making any sense.And the ending is really really predictable.",0,0

After studying 2 or 3 books then seriously u come to know what is the main theme of his story and writing style.If that is Chetan Bhagat book? then there will be one college or young (preety) girl ofcourse one average boy and they started from friendship end with romance thats it, in between you may see some dialogues related to his or her parents or job then finally Epilogue will come to close that incredible story book.So., this book is also deals the same problem.",0,0

Its a true blue CB book! Thank God that Chetan Bhagat quit working and started writing book lest we english readers had to make do with foreign stories that we can't really relate to!The condition of the book is brand new. No wrinkles, no folds. It came wrapped very well with the lovely fragrance that a 'new-book' carries.",0,0

Start is absolutely great, though at some point it may feel a little boring and out of subject for example like the Bill Gates part, but CB has managed to nail it in the new york act, it's brilliantly written. Over all it's a great book, loved it. Especially that chaaaak sound when the ball goes inside without touching the basket, that does really sound like a great music for a bball player..",0,0

8129135728,3,"I'm not a fan of reading fiction books & I'm not a fan of Chetan Bhagat at all. But a friend of mine insisted me to read this book so I read the entire book in a single sitting.It was a good book and was worth the time....but it wasn't anything amazing. It was like a typical Bollywood movie story and was some horrendous stuff, like the guy flying to NYC (No Spoilers)..The only reason I'd recommend you this book is for the Bihari character. It was pretty good.",0,0
8129135728,3,"Chetan bhagat being such a great author has been considerably disappointing with this book. C'mon chetan! I mean really! You are presenting the same old horny heroes that u introduced in your previous books. Nothing new buddy! And for the story, it is extremely Bollywood. But even though the repetitiveness, the book is quite a page turner. You'll read it in a few stretches. That's the only reason for 3 stars. Nevertheless, not highly recommended. Light hearted book. Can be avoided.",0,0

8129135728,4,"I started reading this book with an open mind. I had heard of Chetan Bhagat's reputation as a no nonsense, simple words, kind of author. Have even watched the movies created from his books Five point someone, and 2 states. To be honest the title intrigued me. Hats off to the author. A complex story narrated so simply. Refreshing and Unputdownable is how I'd describe it. The climax was a bit predictable for me though, hence the 4 stars.",0,0

Also while returning one of the product, the pick up guy missed the time allotted and didn't even bring the receipt for me. The delivery could be made more organised...",0,0
8129135728,5,"Again a gr8 work from Mr. bhagat. good story line . so i would recommend to grab and read it atleast one time.  To Amazon:  Apart from this i have one complain from amazon that why no items can be ordered  in U.P. above 5000.  Please raise the bar to atleast 10000 ,  because most of good mobiles and gadgets come in this range only, else i have to migrate to other sites or brick & mortar shop thanks",0,0
8129135728,5,"Amazon has been providing me with a good set of deals for almost a very wide range of products. I couldn't believe the courier guy didn't charge any delivery charges and handed over the book to me for just Rs. 49. That is just great!To be talking about Chetan Bhagat's book, it is great and the only thing I don't like about his books is that they could be completed if you sit for 8 hours straight reading it.",0,0
8129135728,5,I loved this book. It was my first book that i bought on Amazon and read it. My favourite part was THE ONE IN NEWYORK. The book is really amazing....eagerly awaiting for the movie on it.... the handwriting in the book should have been a little bigger so as to enable a more better reading....but overall interesting.And also the packaging of amazon was the best to deliver the book in best condition.,0,0

8129135728,2,"Firstly, I have read Chetans 2 books, and I have noticed he writes in simple English.

The book misses the wow factor. Half GirlfriendYou can read my entire review at [...]",0,0

8129135728,5,If you are going to compare with other books of Chetan Bhagat. Then you may not like it. But This book is a nice piece. You can read it. This is a book shows some mentality of guys. How they love but do some stupid things cause to loose their love. And how girls misjudge guys sometimes and goes away from them by hurting both. I really liked the book. Chetan Bhagat rocks,0,0
8129135728,3,"The book is good. But I expected a little more than what he did. Yah! But still it's good.The reason behind I rated 4* is because, he elaborates a lot. Which I neither like.I still expect a little better from what he has done.I liked the cover of the book HALF GIRLFRIEND. and even the blurb of the book was good.All the best for his next book.",0,0
8129135728,2,"Plot and story line of book is too weak(in fact its same old story line and its boring).Its seems like Chetan Bhagat lost something that been appeared in his previous work but however its a time pass reader(but its not worth your time) and don't expect the witty, funny and simple strong lines of Chetan.one star for chetan effort and one for AMAZON amazing delivery.",0,0

If you were curious for this book but are not habituated of reading, better wait for the movie that will sort it up in hardly 3hrs. So save your time as Time and Tide waits for None.",0,0
8129135728,4,I bought it cause it was for 40 bucks.. Read through it cause i didn't have anything to do in the airport when my flight got delayed and i had thid along.. Decent story.. A bit predictable and has a set of essence of what chetN bhagat always does.. Can't really explain without putting a spoiler.. I'd say read it if you don't have anything better to do.,0,0
8129135728,5,Delivery of book on time and book content is terrific,1,1
8129135728,4,"Thank you very much.As I've read through, I can claim again that I've read all of his books.I cried at the certain page.I felt happy with several other pages.I enjoyed this story.But, as a guy, I don't think a lady behave like this.They do just in the dream of guys, I'm afraid ...hahaha",0,0
8129135728,5,"Best work by chetan bhagat . the book with a awesome title , and a awesome story , it is a story of a common Indian men and upper class Indian girl ..And the thing i like most ...A happy ending ..We Indians love happy ending ...But this book surely make you cry, laugh and again you get a awesome story in every act",0,0
8129135728,4,I thought Chetan Bhagat is no more in my list of sought after Indian writers. However this book has changed that conception. The writing style is simple which is synonymous to the writer and I am glad he brought it back. As you read the book you will realize that some parts of the story are so real and you might have experienced as well.,0,0

8129135728,5,hi everyonethis half girl friend is really awesome. one must read this one. curiosity grows every now and then while reading .its really one of great masterpieces of mr chethan bhagath.i really enjoyed the whole book.i m a big fan of chethanji's writing.,0,0
8129135728,1,Not for any real lover of literature. Absolute nonsense written just for the sake of making another bollywood movie. Even few pages are an absolute torture to read. Its something written for the main masses who like reading only things that have the super duper hype around it.,0,0
8129135728,5,"first of all I would like to declare that I got the product ""FREE OF COST"" from amazon.Really the book is superb.Every page of the book is filled with enormous romance......... I liked it.Thanks to amazon for the understanding & its friendly cooperation.",0,0
8129135728,4,Typical Chetan Bhagat book. You can either love it or hate it. Personally I like it.By the way I would appreciate if Amazon provides the books with the polyethene packages that they came in from the manufacturer. If so other e-commerce giant can then why can't you!,0,0
8129135728,3,"One time read. Would make a cheesy BOLLYWOOD MOVIE. The former 'Chetan Bhagat humour & wit' is mostly missing. The novel lacks any kind of emotional or intellectual depth. However, it's okay for spending your leisure time (better than playing Candy Crush!!!! ;)",0,0

8129135728,5,Mr. Bhagat has a very good foresightedness. That's why he is writing stories which can be used to make an Indian Masala Movie. By the way its a very good novel with a very touching and emotional story of Madhav and Riya Somani. I wish I would be Madhav.,0,0

8129135728,4,"when you are fan of chetan bhagat you only wait to see is there any new outcome by him.. that is wat i personally feel. so when i had this novel by amazon which they delivered on time, i was excited to read it. to give my opinion or review on book would be ke you must have this novel with you. i do not know why chetan sir got so much crtisim for this book. this novel is complete package of entertainment.it surely guarantees you  freindship, love, passion, drama, politics, music everything is here in it. yes, its a love story but do not forget that chetan sir has written it so you are going not only to witness love story but an adventures journey of madhav protognist of novel from whom it starts nd ends well. grab the copy for different yet beautiful story by master story teller of modern india its non other than chetan bhagat. go get it guyss.",1,1

8129135728,4,"Story: 4/5Writing: 3/5Concept: 4/5Immersion: 3/5First, I'm not anti-Bollywood. Not that I'm a big fan either.But this book combines the feel of a good Bollywood movie with words.Starts off slow. The regular famous-college-normal-guy-hot-girl as we see in all the books by the author. I did steal a yawn or two in the first 30-40 pages. But then, going with the hype, and wanting to do justice to the amount I spent, I started reading.*Spoilers Ahead!*When they meet again in Bihar, the story picks up pace and when she leaves, telling him about her lung cancer, the story gets pretty immersing.**Spoilers with extra toppings ahead. Read at your own risk**Well, I do not despise Chetan Bhagat writings (unlike people who ""consider"" themselves to be ""appreciators of literary genius"" do), so I did think that he won't divulge that the girl is dead in the beginning itself. I had kinda expected her to be alive. And so, the book became pretty interesting from then on.Also, description of NYC from the eyes of a common man was brilliant. Him going to New York, to get the love of his life - Cheesy, but well written.",0,0
