B015T0YLAA,1,Worst product i ever bought. When I was charging my phone suddenly some short circuit happened - power bank started to burn . I have charged only for 3 times . In 4th time it burnt - good thing is my apple iphone 5s got escaped from this . If something happened to that - then it would be even more worst review .What can I do for this burnt powerbank - will you repair or replace and give it - I want my power bank to work that's it,539,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"Ordered  : 2016-07-29Delivered  : 2016-08-05Time Taken for Delivery: 6 Days------------------------------------------------Pros:------------------------------------------------1. I bought this product for 1000Rs [2016-August] which is really an exceptional value for money product2. The build quality of the product is very good and seems very durable3. Charging power seems to be moderate (very high = better = to charge your powerbank as well as devices quickly)--------------Power Stats----------------Input Power:  10.5W [5V / 2.1A] - USB Micro-BOutput Power: USB Type A sockets power output below,Socket 1 - 5W [5V / 1A],Socket 2 - 10.5W [5V / 2.1A],Socket 3 - 10.5W [5V / 2.1A]To be honest, the charging power surely gonna drop if you charge 3 devices simultaneously, so to charge a device faster, try to charge a single device and use the 10.5W [5V / 2.1A] port.------------------------------------------------Cons:------------------------------------------------1. Lack of USB C port, as almost all the 2016 flagship devices as well as the new devices are conforming to the futuristic USB C standard.2. Charging power could had been better with 15W or 20W input to power bank.------------------------------------------------Charging Time:[practical time may vary slightly vary by 5 to 10%]------------------------------------------------------------Simple version:-------------DEVICE CHARGING TIME:If you charge your [2500 mAh / 12.5 Wh] smartphone from 0% to 100% using,5W port = takes 2.5 hours [12.5 Wh / 5W]10.5W port = takes around 1 hour 10 mins [12.5 Wh / 10.5W]POWERBANK CHARGING TIME:Time taken to charge your Power bank from 0% to 100% is 5 hours 15 mins [55 Wh / 10.5 W]---------Advanced version:-----------DEVICE CHARGING TIME:If you charge using the below port,5W port = Using 5W [Power] port for 1hr will charge your battery to 5Wh [Energy].10.5W port = Using 10.5W [Power] port for 1hr will charge your battery to 10.5Wh [Energy].Simple words, X Watt charging for 1 hour is called X Wh [Watt hour], X can be any number of watts.For Example, your phone battery energy is as below,2500 mAh = 2.5 Ah = 12.5 WhComing to the point, rough time taken to charge your device is as below,If you charge your phone [2500 mAh / 12.5 Wh] using,5W port = takes 2.5 hours [12.5 Wh / 5W]10.5W port = takes around 1 hour 10 mins [12.5 Wh / 10.5W]POWERBANK CHARGING TIME:Energy of Powerbank = 11,000 mAh = 11 Ah = 55 WhPowerbank input power [micro USB] = 10.5W [5V * 2.1A]Charging Powerbank at 10.5W for one hours gives 10.5 Wh [Energy] to Powerbank,So time taken to charge your Power bank from 0% to 100% is 5 hours 15 mins [55 Wh / 10.5 Wh]------------------------------------------------Additional information:------------------------------------------------*** V, A, Ah units are improper units while denoting power, so Watts [W] would be easier and universal unit for Power, and for Energy Ah or mAh is misleading unit as Voltage (mostly kept at 5V for mobile devices as constant), for Energy [Wh] is the proper and universal unit to use.Simple words, use [W] for Power and [Wh] for Energy.W = V * A10W = 5V * 2A11,000 mAh = 11 Ah = 11 Ah * 5V = 55 WhTo remember easier, suppose 5V is kept as constant considering mobile devices.1 Ah = 5 WhMy Nexus 6P battery storage energy is around ~3,500 mAh = 3.5 Ah = 17.5 WhAnd my Nexus 6P wall charging adapter output power is rated at 15W [5V / 3A].------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please provide a Thumbs up if you got any info from my review.",135,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Dont buy because am facing these problems Am receives used product Full heating problem Dont charge, dont gives power to devices dont on led lights look like, opened and screches in edges is vaste of money, please choose other",5,1
B015T0YLAA,1,It is the worst product that I have received from Amazon..DISSAPOINTED..!!!It stopped working in just 20 days !!,6,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"I frankly didn't have much expectations from this large-mAH powerbank at this price point. It charges portable devices fast but takes its own sweet time to recharge itself, so I leave it on overnight if I have to travel anywhere the next day. It can recharge an iPhone 6S from around 10 percent to full twice AND an iPad 4 once on a single charge.The included cable is extremely short and nearly unusable, but almost everyone should have a spare miniUSB -USB cable lying around. Although the rest of the body is solidly built and feels like it could last a while, the USB ports are tacky and there are times when you literally have to force the cable in or out. Other than these, it serves its job well, and I'm very satisfied with the product. Recommended if you're on a tight budget.",3,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"This charger worked well for the starting 5 days then after that it stopped working. Now , my charger is being charging from last 10 hours and still it is not charged half also , except one LED every LEDs are blinking. Feel cheated from Amazon.  Amazon should stop market & sale  such cheap product.",9,1
B015T0YLAA,5,"Fast delivery, light weight, charges my phone upto 3 times when fully charged. Thumbs up for this.",4,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Works awesome.... Gets charged fast with 2amp charger..... It charges my mobile almost 4 times.. I use Xperia z1 which has 3000mah battery... Very useful... Thank you intex,13,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Worst Product. After 3-4 times of charging, it needs charging for never ending hours. After charging, it will charge your device for 10 Minutes and then it'll die gradually. Some kind of Chinois S***, scrap. Total wastage of money and of course time for checking whether its getting charged or not. Highly Disappointed with Amazon. Final verdict : Don't buy it !!!",55,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Cheated at Rs.899.Product is not good.Don't ever buy it.Fake charges only given by this power bank,55,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Anyone buying this item should immediately open it and put it to charge to check the charging socket, mine is loose...i made a mistake by seeing it after the return date passed!!",2,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Its been 1 week since I am using this power bank. My usage is not very high. It was delivered fully charged, which I used to charge the phone around 3-4 times. Yesterday i kept it for charging first time (charged for around 6 hours). Even after 6 hours of charging, the powerbank was able to charge the phone only 10 % (around 10 mins) and then died. Either i have got a defective piece or the product itself is a low quality chinese junk with intex stamp on it. Intex managed to spoil my first buying experience of their product. Will always avoid Intex products in future. Now trying to return it and get a refund. Poor product. Highly dissatisfied.",113,1
B015T0YLAA,1,It is not 11000 mAh. It might be less than 4500mAh. I charged it completely till  all 4 indicator lights stopped blinking. After that I could charge my 2000mAh phone only twice and it drained completely!!! If it is 11000 I must get at least 5 times.right?,69,1
B015T0YLAA,1,This product is joke.The seller has sent a faulty product.After the battery bank got fully drained i left it charging for a whole day and tried to charge my phone .As soon as i connected my phone it started blinking.I thought my charger may be faulty and used another charger but the same thing happened again.This product is faulty dont buy it.,46,1
B015T0YLAA,1,After one charge the power bank went bust. Why should Amazon tie up and sell such stupid products where quality tests are not there at all. Bought more than 200 items this is by far my worst experience and will never buy an intex product in my life again.,6,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Good to have one nice built. charges the phone well 899 price was well for this product . Have bought 2 of the same. Bulky in nature can't help if you are IOS user you need to carry android charges as well for charging the power bank,6,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"Good product , used this for Motorola Moto G3 which has 2470 mAH battery and it can be charged three times from zero to 100 % using this powe bankCharging speed is faster than phone charger but to charge the power bank it takes almost overnightAfter full charging power bank retains the charge for long time even more than a month or even much more than that",1,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"Excellent power bank..Below are my observations...1)Has capacity of 8000-9000Mah(about 70-80% of 11000Mah)..Its pretty good2)Supports Pass through Charging..3)Charges Phones pretty quick...( faster than conventional charger)4)A Little Bulky5)Value for Money --Bought it at 850 INR6)Has three ports..I used two ports, device gets little hot but it charges both mobiles easily7)Takes 9-10 hours to charge itself...Not a problem..Go for it.....A good competitor for TP Link and ASUS power banks..which are good in quality but little over priced !!",9,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Worst Product..Please friends never ever buy this product..Charges only 1 time of 2100 mAh battery . Its very hard to charge this power bank also...,23,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"Gets charged up reasonably quickly with a 2A charger(about 6 hours) Haven't tried to charge with a 2.1 A charger yet though the company says it is OK. In discharging over a week, I could get 7500 mah in total(2 cycles of testing so far) Not bad but not brilliant either. The main problem is that unlike my Asus Power Bank or my PNY Power Bank, this does not seem to slow down its charging of a phone during the last stage(85% and up) even when you use a battery app like Du Battery on the phone. Because of this, there is heating up and probably some damage to the phone battery(Note 2 in my case) over the last stage. The phone also discharges more quickly from 100% to 85% when charged with this. I don't think this has any safety sensors in place to reduce current when more heat is produced etc. So advice users to only charge in the range 20% to 85% using this powerbank(That is generally good advice for most powerbanks as most phone batteries can be charged at a much higher current in this range and your charging will be much faster) Haven't checked charging with even two ports at a time, let alone all three. But the 1 A outlet port can safely charge Nokia Lumia phones without overheating. I could also charge my Kindle Paperwhite without heating from the 1 A port. The device is heavy but well-built. Nothing shakes inside when you shake the device. Overall, seems OK. Will update this review after more thoroughly testing.For the momentPros:Build qualitySpeed of charging(both itself and devices you charge using this)Decent efficiency over a a week(including the effect of leaking of charge etc. You may get more backup if you use up the power over 3 days)1 A port can charge Nokia Lumia phones and Kindle Paperwhite without heating or any other problemsConsSeriously bulky - both heavy and largeThe 2.1 A ports not good for charging devices with an even mildly lower rating in the last stage. Will not slow down. No safety sensors in evidenceSlightly loose USB ports. Check for 5 minutes for any heating up whenever you hook up something to charge off the power bank or the power bank itself to charge.",76,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Thr LED near charging IN port is not working. ...I have to get this replaced...it also took 3 hrs to charge my phone from 30 % to 90%,23,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"Received Product is worst possible condition. No protection for Power Bank. the package was subject to pressure/shock/drops, as the package shows clear signs for that. not sure if any thing has gone wrong with power bank. So far it's working, but I think i shd return it, as it might cause some issues latter.It's working fine at the moment. the USB cord is too short.Sturdy product, with good built quality.",5,1
B015T0YLAA,3,Size is huge. Problem in carry,37,1
B015T0YLAA,4,Prompt delivery.Good packing.Using it for 5 days. No problems so far. Performing as expected.! year warranty.Thank you,2,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Awesome ProductCame just in 2 Days.Product is not Fake at all. .!!As I bought in Diwali sale its just cost me of 299/-,56,1
B015T0YLAA,1,The power bank has failed my expectation as it takes hell of lot of time to charge and does not retain charge for long. It has failed to hold charge fr a night and also not been able to charge two mobiles or to say charge a mobile twice in a day itself. Poor quality and very bad experience with the product.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,I used 5V 1A charger to charge the power bank and keep charging for 10 hours stil the 2 nd led is bkinking. Did ny1 temme how much time will dis take to attain full charge of powerbank?,18,1
B015T0YLAA,1,It burnt up as soon as two USBs are put inside . Cant be repaired and the seller refused to take any action.,2,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Power bank spoiled within 2 months of purchase . Only poor quality products are available in amazon I guess,2,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"What is wrong with this device?1) If I am charging two devices at once, it will charge for a bit and then just go off and then you'll have to hit the charge button again.2) It almost never works with 2 devices and they have 3 ports so it is defective3) Although it does have the ability to hold a long time charge, it seldom works the way it is intended toHaving used Portronics before, I would say you should never buy the intex power bank because it is a disappointment. What good is a power bank if you have to keep checking on it to see if it transmitting power to the devices?",25,1
B015T0YLAA,5,it was realy a good product and i am realy happy to bought  this product..... mansour mudaber from Afghanistan now live in India Coimbatore.,18,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"Received the product with in 48hrs, its amazing delivery by amazon. I have got this for 299. Amazing device, light weight and I have charged my Redmi 2 twice from morning and not even one of the power indicator is down. Good product. Pros: stylish to look and not heavy to hold . Can carry easily on pocket.  Three USB ports on one device.  Cons:  Not charging faster, it is taking same time on the phone charger and on this power bank.",41,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Excatly as it is described. And I specially like the extra 1.5v output for Apple and Blackberry.,2,1
B015T0YLAA,4,It's a goad product to take for long trips and can be ur life saver at crucial times 11000 mah can itself fully charge a iPhone 3 times... Guys u got a full battery powerhouse and i myself after using this product m totally satisfied with the performance shown by it...,1,1
B015T0YLAA,3,Using it from last two days. 11000mah doesn't seem to work completely. It charges my 2300mah phnoe battery thrice only. Charging speed is equivalent to that of charger.Satisfied with product but slightly not upto expectations.Delivered prior Delivery time.,5,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Power bank is very good. I am using Samsung galaxy NOTE 3 which has 3200 MAH battery and I was able to charge 3 times full and still there was power left in Power Bank. its been just 3 days that I am using this but I did not find any problem in the product. Must Buy thing!,5,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Great product by Intex. Delivery was a bit late. I am now using this product for 2 weeks now the powerbank is working as expected.Pros: 1) Good built quality.  2) 11000 mAh for just Rs 999.  3) Charges the device as expected.Cons: 1) Bulky product.,17,1
B015T0YLAA,4,I have been using this product for almost a month now. For me product received was well packed. Charging time for power bank and other phones is as mentioned in description. Cable length is lesser than normal chargers but i feel it's good enough for a power bank.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"This is 3rd class product in it's category.I found ,it takes whole day and night for charging and sometimes even in two days.when it comes to charge phone (2600 mah battery) it can give  charging for two times only.so not worth as a power bank.",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"I was able to charge mobile only twice. Thats all.. I had spent such huge amount to charge my mobile for twice. Not a impressive product i have seen. Or probably i have got a defective device. If it is defective, then please get my product replaced.",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Not very happy with the product quality. First few days were good. But after about 2 weeks it developed issues while charging and now refuses to charge at all! No voltage or power surge issues recently at my house so can't say it is because of that.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Worst product. I don't think it is original, it should be fake . The four lights are glowing together even the power bank is not fully charged. The power bank is not getting fully charged even left in the cord for the whole day ie 24 hrs .",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,This power bank I am using since last 40 days....its not working properly....hardly able to my 3000 may battery once only although it is 11000 may battery power bank.I am happy using this product...do not buy it,5,1
B015T0YLAA,3,"The package arrived at time. Thanks amazon. This product build quality is good, but the backup is not up to the mark. The product drains charge quickly after one time charging. I don't recommend anyone to buy this. I'm disappointed.",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Worst Product.. I got the Packing already opened Means the seal was broken and then the upper most socket was not working properly. Highly Disappointed Returned it back !!,13,1
B015T0YLAA,4,"It charges the phone quite well, and does charge two phones at once, which is a good thing. However, it takes long to charge the powerbank. The body is sturdy and a little heavy but that's okay. But over all, its a good product. :)",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Never buy this power bank. Its useless..not able to charge anything from it..,2,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"At first i was thinking that amazon is a good website to order things but after getting this product i have changed my mind. After this i am not going to order a single thing from here . This charger worked well for the starting 5 days then after that it stopped working. Now , my charger is being charging from last 10 hours and still it is not charged half also , except one LED every LEDs are blinking !!!!! If amazon will not give me a complete solution for this then i am going to file a case in the consumer court !!!!!",8,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Stopped working from day 5...that was the day 2of use! Utter waste of money.,2,1
B015T0YLAA,1,This product is not worth it's money.Pros : NothingCons : Taking long time to charge (charged 4 times all the times it took more than 6 Hrs)  after 50% of charge (Lumia 730) The power bank 2 LED's went off.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Disgusting thing.Worked great for 2 weeks and then stopped suddenly and not working any more..Initially you will feel that its a great thing in great price but after some time you will know you've been cheated.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Used it for a month now. Does not support full 11,000MAH .Has only 4,000mah capacity. good enough to charge a smart phone for nlyabout 1 to 2 times max. Wanted to use this on a bike trip. But it wont suffice for sure.",32,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Good product.... Works as per expectation. I can charge my iPhone and another android phone simultaneously. This thing gets fully charged in just few hours and as the product is handy can be easily taken in a pocket.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Not satisfied with the product.....it is the used one which I received.,2,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Today i m get this product..how to close LED light ...when i receive this power bank its led light is already started...just help me on this pleaseits continuous ON.how to off this led light ?,1,1

B015T0YLAA,3,"I bought it few months ago, but I used only few times. When i received this product  it was already charged. I used it to charge my phone for about 3 times and it worked good. I observed that this power bank charged my phone faster than with regular charging process. So felt happy. But after few days power bank went dark so I planned it to charge with laptop but i felt it was taking longtime, so I tried charging the power bank with a samsung charger, I charged it for 12 hours but the lights are still blinking. I didn't understand whether it is fully charged or not, instructions given on the leaflet didnt give any clear indications. Im not able to understand the order of four LEDs 1-2-3-4 . I would have rated this product 4 stars but lack of information about usage of the product that too by Intex forced me to give it a 3 star.",15,1
B015T0YLAA,1,I purchased this product on 13th november 2015 and today this is burnt out itself in my bag while travelling.thank god my reamainig goods are not harmed.and how can i claim for my product..plz help,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Horrible product. After complaining, the seller told me to take back my rating and try 3/4 other ways like changing the wire, using the 2.2 port. But shockingly the battery provides a back of only 1,000 MAH and not 11,000, which is only 10%......Waste of money....DO NOT BUY at all.",12,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Product not workin please reply immediatelyVery disappointed,2,1
B015T0YLAA,4,he product quality is very good as always from Amazon. The charging speed is also fast as compared our ordinary mobile chargers. Also one unique feature of this product is we can charge 3 mobiles or tablets at a time.,16,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"After one month of use, it can't even charge two 2500mAh mobile batteries.Wanted to return on 2nd day but could not because its box was destroyed.AGAIN VERY POOR PRODUCT FROM INTEX.",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,I have used it for 2 days on first day light wasn't working properly then I thought to charge it properly after charging it was oki then second day it stopped working so Nt at all worth buying,1,1

B015T0YLAA,1,Very bad product....first time dissapointment by amazon providing such product...not even once my cell was charged fully...even though my battery capacity is 2800mah....poor service by amazon,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,This product is not upto the mark. It stopped working after three weeks of its purchase...neither it is getting fully charged nor it is able to fully charge an smart phone. So better avoid it,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"No , i am not Satisfied its Battery after 10 days of Use is now not charging fully .. i never see 4 lights stable ie Fully charged now . Not worth .. Just fit for Use not FIT FOR PURPOSE ...",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Stopped working within 2 months. Would not recommend to anyone,2,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Doesn't work after 4 months... You won't even get an exchange after that. Very bad quality. No point of buying it for such low price of it doesn't even serve purpose for least 6 months,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Product has LED output. After 25 days of usage, I see that when charged LED always remain. Return policy says, eligibility is revoked after 15 days of usage. Expecting some support.",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Getting a wierd 'eeeeee' noise while i am charging, very irritating.I received the product with the torch ON, that was really sad and not sure if that is a good thing.",1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,This power bank is of 11000mAh so the battery life is supposed to be longer..but in this case the battery life is too small. This power bank is fake..!! Please dont purchase this.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Worst product from a reputed site like amazon....dangerous too....It was blasted when I am using it....don't buy this product...The people who bought this should be very cautious,1,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Loved itPros1..  Capacity is good2.. 3 usb ports3.. Slim and is nicely designed4.. led torch as wellCons:1..Price is tooooo high,1,1
B015T0YLAA,3,All fine with this bank. I do get to charge 3 - 5 devices from 10 - 100%. Knocked off a star for taking too much time to charge and a second one for the charge indicator it goes from 2 lights to 0 all of a sudden. Some programming logic error there. Also the led light could have been brighter - the charging lights are real bright and I guess they eat a lot of power.Still overall a good product. The product is a bit big and heavy to just slip in the pocket. Ideal for going on holidays and when you require multiple recharges.,0,0
B015T0YLAA,1,I had purchased 2 intex IT-PB but both are not working satisfactorily. Please arrange for replacement or take back and arrange for refund of the amount at the earliest. Thanks,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,Very very poor performance.I replaced it twice because it got turned off while I tried to use all of the three ports..even with two ports it turns off due to heat problem.Even after replacing I got the same issue now have applied for refund.Go for PNY battery instead of this.,8,1

B015T0YLAA,5,Very good product. I'm using it for more than 6 months.PROS1. notification is goodCON1. whole power bank takes less than 10 hr to charge,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,It takes more than 14 hours to full charge. And doesn't change a 1950 mah phone even for 3 times that means it is less than 6000 mah. Lost trust in Amazon and intex.,1,1

B015T0YLAA,5,This product is little bit heavy to carry but easy to use compatible with most of the android and IOS devices.

Initially I feel very sad about it but after contacting to Amazon I elaborated the whole incident. The response from Amazon was very nice, they assured me to provide me the another powerbank. Also I got it. Thanks for Amazon for its kind response. Secondaly coming to power bank, it is very good in terms of Quality. It charges my Iphone 3-4times and also charging is very fast as compared to port. It has three USB ports which can be used for multi charging. As well as LED light quite good. The only thing I want to advice the manufacturer/ Amazon is about the charging cable, it is too short to reach the power bank. Good and worth for money.",10,1
B015T0YLAA,1,I bought this product on August 2016. One day it stopped working and the led torch started to light automatically and was not able to switch it off.

Charged ZenFone 5 at least 2.5 times. The plastic cover finish is decent. But if you compare, the product size it is double the size & weight that of MI powerbank or ASUS Zenpower. The weight would be combined weight of 3 cellphones (reminded me of the size of first mobile phones launched in 1998). Due to unavailability of MI and high pricing of Asus Zenpower, Sony, Lenovo, this bank will be the only option for budget buyers.

B015T0YLAA,5,"Hey everyone!I bought this power bank on a whim when it was on a supposed sale for Rs. 999 (The same price it is now) and I've been using it since the fourth week of January. Here's my breakdown on the product!The bank is decent for a base-level product. It's got a big battery. The battery indicator is pretty misleading however. This thing gives my phone (A Samsung Galaxy S6) 3 full charges, but after the first full charge, the battery indicator tells me the power bank is at 1 star remaining charge.Ah well! The price is great for the functionality Intex provides, and I'm pretty happy with this. I have an e-cig too, and I don't want to be stranded without a phone or a vape in tough times, so I made the small investment.Pros:* Price* Built-in torch (Haha)* A 1 amp port for the safety of devices that can't accept more than that without safety implications.* Build quality is pretty solid. Dropped it twice, no damage or hindrance caused.* Decent backup. Rarely needed to charge this.Cons:* The battery indicator is NOT accurate. Might give you a heart attack in an emergency and make you wonder how much juice you've got left in it. Pretty major for a power bank.* The torch is pretty dim. (:D)* You can not charge the power bank and devices through your power bank at the same time. I guess the charging circuit isn't segregated for that purpose.* The power bank would've looked better in an ""all black"" configuration. The strip on the side ruins it.* The voltage is NOT regulated, meaning it'll try and charge devices that support 1 amp only with 2 amps of current and it'd be a serious safety issue (Overheating to say the least) to leave these devices plugged in for anything other than phones. Tread with caution.Overall, I'd give this power bank a solid 4/5. No detractions on performance. The 2 amp ports are pretty great and charge devices that support it pretty quickly.Would recommend!",6,1
B015T0YLAA,2,Not so cool. In starting it was charging my fon min 4 times. But now after 5 months one full charge is critical.,1,1

Too early to comment on any other parameters.Two design issues that made me wonder whether I should've gone for a more expensive (I mean better designed, but how will I know before I try?):1. The power button is awkward and gets easily pressed even when in my laptop bag. Even the torch turns on this way.2. The battery bank switch off function seems unreliable. I have to try multiple times before it switches off (torch turns on and off on double-press, reliably).Other remarks: Power Bank is pretty heavy for its size.",3,1

B015T0YLAA,4,"First of all, delivery of this product took place on time. It was quick and efficient.The product is working pretty decently though it's too early to comment coz I have used this product for just 5 days. One drawback of this product is that it's quite heavy. The product has a decent look.",0,0
B015T0YLAA,1,"Writing this review after 8few days of constant use.The battery says it's 11000mAh, but I hardly think so.....I have been using this to charge my moto G  but it hardly charges for 2 times and that too not full and it takes too long to charge even at 2.1 amps.Comparing  the time to charge and the output, I don't think it has 11000mAh capacity . so if you are looking for a good backup don't buy... If you are looking for a reduce, it's fine.  Overall experience is worst.. Not suitable for heavy use which actually it should do.",6,1
B015T0YLAA,3,"I'd say do not go for it. The battery capacity seemed to decrease within a month or two of usage, I'm not a heavy user either, The maximum output I got from this was 9000mah which is okay compared to others in the same price range, but after two months it became 7500mah. Also after two months it took almost one and half days to charge it fully and it drains faster. No response from intex either.",3,1
B015T0YLAA,5,Back up is really appreciable. But its not handy its a bit big when compared to other power banks size. Three ports give us much room for multiple gadgets to charge.

B015T0YLAA,5,Buy it only if you often need to go somewhere  where you constantly use your mobile phone. Otherwise for home purpose it is a wastage of money. As it needs more than 24 hours to get fully charged and if kept unused it's battery will go down.,0,0

B015T0YLAA,5,"Intex power bank is very good. I got it for 949. On 23rd jan 2016, rate was 899.With this power bank, I am able to charge oneplus 2, two times from zero to 100%. Even after that, the power bank has enough juice since it shows two lights as remaining charge. But the problem is that it will not charge a 2 Amp phone, like the oneplus 2, with only 2 lights remaining. But it will charge any old 1 Amp phone for a long time even if two lights are remaining.So as per the worst case scenario power bank formula, if both multipliers are at 0.75, we have 11000 x 0.75 x 0.75 = 6187 mah. Since it charges one plus 2, two times, it definitely has 6600 mah real capacity, plus it can charge old 1 amp phones even  after that.I am now planning to charge two of oneplus 2 phones together and see how the power bank fares. Will update later.Update: There is a trick to charge two oneplus 2 phones together. Oneplus 2, having 3300 mah battery, draws current on higher side, like tablets. If both oneplus 2 phones are having zero charge left, then this power bank will not charge them together. Some sort of ""inbuilt short circuit"" protection kicks in.The trick is to charge both phones individually up-to 25% first. After that, it can charge both phones together. You can experiment to find out lower values and write in comments, so that it helps others.Phones having say 2500 mah battery can be charged two at same time. I have charged oneplus 2 (3300 mah) and oneplus x (2250 mah) together each having zero charge.Thanks for reading my review, if you like it, please press the like button.",2,1

B015T0YLAA,4,It is good product. I just bought it. Please remember that when you buy a power bank of any mAh of any company just divide its mAh by 2 to get its actual power you will never be disappointed. There is some fuss in calculation of mAh by its company& its actual power because all companies are not cheaters.. However I have used it twice & it charges my Sam Sung Galaxy J-7 (2600) 2 and a half times taking 1.3 to 2 hours in charging a mobile that is quite satisfactory as it will reach you from Delhi to Chennai with charged mobile listening music continuously- I played chess all the time I was waking-(What else you want). It is charged in 5.3 hours to 6 hours which is a normal time.Its torch is a bonus & all 3 charging slot work fine (But you can use only two at a time (Attachment problem could precipitate). It probably made to run till 500-800 charging cycles that is more than required unless you are a TTE & always travel with un-charged mobile ha ha ha. Since like all power banks it has fixed charging cycles you are advised to charge it completely & drain it completely to ensure its long life. It is Intex- a brand of loyalty so no second though. I was going to buy Samsung but reviews scared me a lot & with Sony also I faced same issues. I am more than happy with this. Lastly about few disappointed users I say either the piece is defective (That could be replaced by Amazon) or they expected  real mAh in an 11000 mAh battery (Friends you will never get this in any power bank- believe me).. I am not a paid blogger but a doctor.,1,1
B015T0YLAA,1,"Its been 2 week since I am using this power Intex IT-PB11K 11000 mAh Power Bank (White).My usage is not very high. It was delivered fully charged, which I used to charge the phone around 3-4 times. Yesterday i kept it for charging first time (charged for around 6 hours). Even after 6 hours of charging, the powerbank was able to charge the phone only 10 % (around 10 mins) and then died. Either i have got a defective piece or the product itself is a low quality chinese junk with intex stamp on it. Intex managed to spoil my first buying experience of their product. Will always avoid Intex products in future. Now trying to contact service center in NOIDA but there is no response from them in last 2 days and when I tried to call on toll free number and complain about the poor service then they are updating that contact detail is not updated on INtex site and they will share the updated contact detail but the contact detail shared by them was also the old one.

It's particularly useful when I'm about to leave the house and I realize that my phone battery is about to die. I plug the small cable into my phone and put the device in my bag. You also tell exactly how much charge is left in the device by the number of illuminated led lights on the front. Four means fully charged. Initially I was annoyed that the cable provided with it is too short (about a foot) but that's actually an advantage when you're carrying it around in your bag/purse all day. The only con is that there is no socket adapter included, so I use my phone's. Just charge it overnight and you're good to go for a few days.",1,1

Got a couple of other friends to get it as well. I got for 899 on the sale which is a steal! My mom uses the INTEX phone & i even got an INTEX washing machine!

As compared to my old power bank from a different manufacturer this one is very good. Its size is as big as your palm and is very smooth. Also, it feels very elegant holding it in your hands. One thing I have noticed with this power bank is that the 1A and the 2A ports are mixed and not where they are indicated. But, that is just a small problem.",5,1

B015T0YLAA,2,"I was excited to get the powerbank from Intex...Since I thought1) The 11000mah should be enough to last 3-4 times charging of my phone.2) It had a bypass charging capability (that means you can charge your phone while charging the Powerbank.3) It had 3 outlets two for 2.1 A fast charging and one 1A charging..Amazon did deliver in good time. The package and the device looked great.I have only used the device for less than 1 month....it worked good for only few days...It initially charged my Coolpad phone with 3050 mah battery quickly 2-3 times..But to my surprise...I started to see some Cons after few usages.The Charger's Power retention is horrible.If I did not use the Powerbank for couple days after 100% charging, it seems to drain to almost 50%, with only 2 led lights showing while charging.Also, as days passed by, it started to do weird stuff.Now, it does not charge my phone with one led light on (i.e. at 25%)When I charge the power bank, one light blinks continuously and the device does not charge even if I keep plugged in for few hours.I have to get it replaced or get repaired.Painful task for me to get that done..Have to find time..Could have gotten Xiaomi charger. But instead, I got enticed by 2 fast +1 std outputs, power bypass features on this Intex device.",0,0

B015T0YLAA,2,"Well, Its been a week since I have received this product and I am not entirely satisfied with the product. Following are my observations:1. The product comes with local data cable that discharge the power bank instead of charging it.2. Also I have tried charging 4-5 times my One plus X which has 2750 mAh battery and I couldn't charged my phone more than twice.3. Thirdly power bank took 4-5 hours for charging for half of the battery which seems pretty slow or charging is not adequate.It seems seller has delivered me a second hand product and I guess I would ask for replacement or return. Although from product point of view its build up is good, sturdy & have solid body with less heating issues. The product is very good if it works as per specifications.",0,0

B015T0YLAA,4,"I guess it's the cheapest 11,000mAh power bank available in the market as of today (Maybe I'm wrong). A decent product worth less than Rs. 1000. Not too big at all, and could be placed in your pocket easily.Has two output ports of 5V-2.1A and one 5V-1A, which is really cool for diffident cell phones. Also has a cool LED bulb that can be used as a torch.Though the torch turns on automatically when it's in my bag at times (Maybe due to the way I handle it).Definitely worth the money and a good service by Amazon.",2,1
B015T0YLAA,4,What I liked:1) 3 USB ports for charging.2) Charge level indicator. But most of the power banks comes with these option now these days.3) Fast charging.What I didn't like:1) Build quality is average. Plastic cover seems like it might come apart any time.2) Big size. I won't fit into your pocket. You will need to have a bag to carry it.3) Charging cable provided is of low quality.4) Weight is more when compared with other power banks that are available for the same price range.Fast delivery by Amazon. Item was delivered in 2 days ( got in on second day morning). Packaging is also good.,0,0
B015T0YLAA,3,This powerbank doesn't deliver the promised full 11000 mAH power.... its a max 6000 to 8000 mAH...,1,1

B015T0YLAA,1,This product right here is the worst power bank you can ever buy. And please do not ever give it as a gift.First of all it is definitely not 11000 mah. it would be more like 3500/4500. because it does not charge the phone more than once.And with time even that does not work. you will  be left with a white rectangular box.Go for Ambrane power banks. I have used one and it is working flawlessly. Hope this helps.,2,1

I bought that from ebay. in on very lower price. That was fake.This intex power bank is really amazing. I am very glad to buy it and it is worth for money. It takes long time to get charge but its ok. Its a common thing for all kind of power banks either original or fake.If you want to check originality of the power bank that is it real or fake so do one thing, keep on charge power bank and connect your mobile to charge it simultaneously. If your mobile is also getting charge while power bank then its original and if not its fake. I tried this and on intex power bank and wow it was working.I strongly recommended to buy it. Go for it. Don't think so much and buy blindly.I already given delivery feedback. Thanks a ton Amazon for your excellent service. I am genuine customer of Amazon and have superb experience till yet.
